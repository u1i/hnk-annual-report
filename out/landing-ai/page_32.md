Unlock the full potential of our people <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.024,r=0.415,b=0.064), with ID 4f23d697-054c-44eb-8c20-eefc59559ca0 -->

## Safety, health and wellbeing

Nothing matters more than the safety and wellbeing of our people. We believe every single person who works for and with us should benefit from a positive and nourishing working environment and, above all, return home safely each day. A range of activities in 2024 supported our ambition to shape a leading health and safety culture. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.081,r=0.295,b=0.298), with ID 87610388-09b0-4bfa-b9f7-e35c7465d6ff -->

Every year we run Safety Week, a global HEINEKEN event that highlights our ongoing commitment to safety, helping to raise awareness and embed the right practices. This year's theme was 'Safety at Heart!' A variety of initiatives emphasised the importance of treating our own safety and that of our colleagues with the same care we show for loved ones. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.302,r=0.295,b=0.436), with ID 34b608c6-0690-46e0-9f24-2906853e6392 -->

Elsewhere, the introduction of a cultural programme in 2024 empowered all operating companies to assess their health and safety culture, identify gaps and develop improvement plans to close them. So far, 49 locations have embraced the initiative with more to follow in 2025. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.441,r=0.292,b=0.558), with ID b9e5930a-6412-4f16-9691-d31870e99fc2 -->

We extended our transformation programme that supports select functions and operational companies based on safety performance. In Mexico for example, a heat stress initiative was introduced after an exceptionally hot summer affected employee health. Measures such as additional breaks, improved awareness of the importance of hydration, adjusted shift management and facility upgrades addressed and improved both safety and well being. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.075,r=0.523,b=0.257), with ID 1acadf60-697c-41c2-965a-e81b6c0552b3 -->

While we have significantly reduced the severity of incidents across our business, we deeply regret that two persons lost their lives while working for us in 2024. An independent investigation team thoroughly investigates every fatality to understand the root cause, and we take action to prevent recurrence and share learnings. Looking ahead, we’ll continue to strengthen and embed an empowering health and safety culture and integrate leadership on safety across our business. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.262,r=0.518,b=0.452), with ID 3d536ddf-b557-4809-9e09-11dc6c8d4b78 -->

Social sustainability

We continued to advance our social sustainability ambition in 2024 in pursuit of an ever fairer, more equal and safer company – and society. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.465,r=0.512,b=0.606), with ID 6f5557b6-c5a5-409e-b6f5-72fa05d64ced -->

One initiative was the expansion of our global Trusted Representatives programme, which fosters a global community of more than 500 employees dedicated to supporting colleagues who are witnessing or experiencing potential misconduct. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.609,r=0.520,b=0.708), with ID 400113b2-afbf-49d9-a2e7-0e0af1c805c1 -->

This year, we ran training in two critical areas: fraud and human rights. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.076,r=0.743,b=0.117), with ID a318d39e-75d6-4734-a390-793a78a28857 -->

We made significant progress on including waste pickers in the citizenship agenda of economically developing countries, improving their working conditions and supporting our circularity strategy. In Brazil, the HEINEKEN Institute partnered with local authorities to enhance visibility and boost conditions for waste pickers. What began as a state-level initiative has evolved into a best practice model that is receiving support from the Federal Government for replication across six additional states as a national public policy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.124,r=0.749,b=0.330), with ID dedce533-cfb5-4576-b5e8-39047d6e574f -->

As the world’s most international brewer, our
operations span diverse geographies including high-
risk and, at times, conflict-affected areas. In
Myanmar, heightened Human Rights Due Diligence
(hHRDD) was conducted across our value chain,
covering conflict risk, human rights evaluations and
management systems reviews. The findings
confirmed our ability to operate responsibly through
robust management systems while contributing to
the safety and economic stability of our employees,
their families and local communities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.336,r=0.747,b=0.543), with ID 6e0559bd-9123-4b4d-bfb3-3afe7545802e -->

Areas for improvement, particularly in inland logistics, were addressed through collaboration with suppliers to enhance safety and working conditions. In more volatile regions, we refined our approach to protecting people and communities near our breweries through a refreshed approach to our ongoing training for security forces in key Africa and Middle East markets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.076,r=0.974,b=0.235), with ID 607dc3fb-4c30-4183-ab4f-68f8191b2207 -->

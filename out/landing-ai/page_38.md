# Risk management

## Integrated approach

At HEINEKEN, Risk Management is an integral part of doing business, supported by clear governance. Risks are an essential element when opportunities are assessed and strategies are set. Management decisions are made in line with HEINEKEN’s risk appetite. Risks are identified, mitigated and monitored on an ongoing basis, as part of business routines. The increased volatility in recent years due to an uncertain geopolitical landscape has elevated the importance of active risk management. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.025,r=0.293,b=0.291), with ID 371b9aef-e07c-47e4-96bf-39e1ee150370 -->

HEINEKEN’s risk management approach addresses the risks the Company faces in achieving its strategy; managing these risks in a conscious manner increases the likelihood of meeting our business objectives. A proactive approach ensures risk management is part of our executive conversations and is embedded in our processes. This benefits our decision-making and is essential to create and preserve long-term value. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.294,r=0.293,b=0.468), with ID 21fb3c82-d3da-4654-bdaf-f7e0786dacc4 -->

Risk Management is part of the HEINEKEN Business Framework
The HEINEKEN business framework articulates the key elements that the Company relies on to operate effectively and deliver long-term value creation while protecting its people, assets and reputation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.473,r=0.295,b=0.604), with ID ba528703-159e-4fac-9e5e-abed8bb5d97a -->

Our Purpose, Our Dream and Our Values underpin our EverGreen strategy, enabled by our organisational structure and strong governance. The behaviours give clear guidance to all employees on how to act and foster a culture of achievement, collaboration and growth, underpinned by a Behaviours Framework that reflects the expected attitudes in decision-making. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.606,r=0.293,b=0.742), with ID 21e222f8-9bd3-455c-9492-b91525377b47 -->

Continuous Risk Management supports the
achievement of business objectives, based on our Risk
Assessment Cycle, the HEINEKEN Code of Business
Conduct and the HEINEKEN Rules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.745,r=0.293,b=0.828), with ID 28c26cd8-bcd5-4791-8697-eae972d73623 -->

As part of the Risk Assessment Cycle, operating companies and their Management Teams review and update their risks on a continuous basis throughout the year. The Code of Business Conduct and its underlying policies set out HEINEKEN’s commitment to conduct business with integrity and fairness, and respect for the law and our values. The HEINEKEN Rules articulate how we work and the Standards to which we commit. They are a key element for managing the risks faced by our Company and translating our objectives into clear instructions on how to conduct our daily business. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.071,r=0.743,b=0.188), with ID 5b5684f1-8e9c-42e9-9e7a-8f52ef27a875 -->

HEINEKEN’s systems of risk management and internal control, which are based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control Reference model, form a fundamental part of the HEINEKEN Business Framework. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.304,t=0.191,r=0.733,b=0.254), with ID 2d79d08c-e1fd-4d71-8e9c-3470aa59af10 -->

flowchart:
# Nodes :
  • "Our Purpose, Our Dream and Our Values" (horizontal green rectangle, top center)
  • "Behaviours - How we act" (green rectangle, left)
  • "EverGreen Strategy" (white rectangle, center)
  • "Governance - How we govern internally" (green rectangle, right)
  • "Code of Business Conduct - How we behave - Policies" (green rectangle, below Behaviours)
  • "HEINEKEN Rules - How we work - Laws and Regulations, Standards and Procedures" (green rectangle, below EverGreen Strategy)
  • "Risk Management - How we manage risks - Monitoring and Assurance" (green rectangle, below Governance)
  • "People" (grey rectangle, bottom left)
  • "Processes" (grey rectangle, bottom center-left)
  • "Systems" (grey rectangle, bottom center-right)
  • "Data" (grey rectangle, bottom right)
  • "Execution and change management" (text, bottom center below grey rectangles)

# Connectors :
  • Downward arrows from "Our Purpose, Our Dream and Our Values" to "Behaviours", "EverGreen Strategy", and "Governance".
  • Rightward arrow from "Behaviours" to "EverGreen Strategy".
  • Leftward arrow from "Governance" to "EverGreen Strategy".

  • Leftward arrow from "Risk Management" to "HEINEKEN Rules".

# Layout :
  • Three main columns: Behaviours (left), EverGreen Strategy (center), Governance (right).
  • Each main column has a secondary node below it.
  • The bottom row consists of four grey rectangles ("People", "Processes", "Systems", "Data") spanning the width, with "Execution and change management" as a label beneath.

# Analysis :
  • The framework is hierarchical and integrative, starting from overarching purpose and values, branching into three pillars (behaviours, strategy, governance), each with supporting policies, rules, and risk management.
  • The central "EverGreen Strategy" is linked bidirectionally with both "Behaviours" and "Governance", indicating its integrative role.
  • The bottom layer (People, Processes, Systems, Data) underpins execution and change management, suggesting these are foundational enablers for the framework's implementation.
  • The diagram emphasizes alignment between values, conduct, compliance, risk, and operational execution. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.261,r=0.747,b=0.649), with ID fe44f07c-69a3-43a9-bccb-dbceca167362 -->

Risk profile
HEINEKEN is predominantly a single-product business, operating throughout the world in the alcohol industry. HEINEKEN is present in more than 70 countries, with a growing share of its revenues originating from emerging markets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.663,r=0.737,b=0.753), with ID 4a924e8b-1434-4792-b7f9-3fd5dd785681 -->

HEINEKEN has undertaken business activities with other market parties in the form of joint ventures and
strategic partnerships and with independent distributors. Where HEINEKEN does not have effective control,
decisions taken by these entities may not be fully harmonised with HEINEKEN's strategic objectives. Moreover,
HEINEKEN may not be able to identify and manage risks to the same extent as in the rest of the Group. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.303,t=0.756,r=0.745,b=0.839), with ID bec2e9d9-ed24-4a18-a219-06d00efef020 -->

Risk appetite  
HEINEKEN’s risk appetite is the result of its wide geographical spread, prudent financial management and commitment to long-term value creation. Risks are taken consciously, assessing their impact on HEINEKEN’s objectives. The level of risk HEINEKEN is willing to take depends on the type of objective it impacts (reputational, financial or business continuity related). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.071,r=0.974,b=0.254), with ID 4beed891-f41b-41fc-b989-7039dbe5b498 -->

HEINEKEN Vietnam is partnering with the National
Traffic Safety Committee to address drinking and
driving through its ‘When You Drive, Never Drink’
programme. The programme is delivered in
universities, office buildings, commercial centres and
shopping malls. It invites people to engage in
educational activities with two main objectives:
raising awareness of drinking and driving and
providing resources and tools to change behaviours. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.074,r=0.293,b=0.258), with ID 0deddc59-45e7-4659-8b3b-d8715cee15fa -->

Our active engagement in the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD) highlights our dedication to promoting responsible consumption on a global scale. Through IARD, we collaborate with leading producers of beer, wine and spirits to elevate standards in online sales and digital marketing. IARD’s new Digital Guiding Principles contain five safeguards that, as an industry, we need to apply on all digital communication channels such as social media profiles, websites and apps. The industry commitment is to be 95% compliant by end of 2024. HEINEKEN is 98% compliant with the principles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.262,r=0.295,b=0.492), with ID 9ef3a659-7d3d-4968-8f4b-7e7b6ca65573 -->

Making moderation cool
We have a long history of using our brands to make moderation and responsible consumption cool. We use the strength of our brands – particularly our global Heineken® brand – to ensure that this message resonates with consumers through campaigns that shape the debate. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.075,r=0.517,b=0.220), with ID b91aaf9b-6c76-43a5-a43a-0595b2845236 -->

Our goal is to reach 1 billion unique consumers yearly with a responsible consumption message. We aim to accomplish this by investing 10% of our Heineken® media spend in responsible consumption campaigns. In 2024, 15% of Heineken® media spend has been invested by our operating companies to deliver this important message to consumers, reaching 1.1 billion unique consumers worldwide. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.224,r=0.515,b=0.396), with ID 44505dbb-2e63-4677-9914-5651174ae39a -->

‘When You Drive, Never Drink’ is our long-standing flagship campaign. Building on last year, we leveraged ‘The Best Driver’ campaign, featuring four-time Formula 1 World Champion Max Verstappen, with Player 0.0 – HEINEKEN’s first global gaming programme that uses a bespoke mobile game as an activation layer. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.074,r=0.750,b=0.210), with ID 67025444-90d8-4e22-ad13-65566bb3c48a -->

Our player 0.0 initiative reinforces the message that ‘The Best Driver is not the fastest driver, but the one who is not drinking’. We continued to scale Player 0.0, with activations in over 20 markets this year. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.215,r=0.745,b=0.294), with ID b21347e4-0e72-4fb3-99c7-ad727556fd8c -->

In Mexico, we created a local spin-off of the Max Verstappen campaign, leveraging Sergio Pérez to deliver the ‘When You Drive, Never Drink’ message. You can see one of the videos here. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.298,r=0.741,b=0.377), with ID 2a1993f2-5680-49a4-8180-2dd431f1d2dd -->

“Four years into developing and executing our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy, sustainability and responsibility are now an integral part of how we operate. I am proud of the progress we’ve made but I know there is more for us to do as we navigate challenges and trade-offs. Brew a Better World remains the foundation as we continue to learn, evolve and partner with others to deliver our goals.”

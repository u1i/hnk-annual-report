appointed for a maximum period of four years and
that a member may be re-appointed for a term of
not more than four years at a time. In compliance

Board has drawn up a rotation schedule to avoid,
as much as possible, a situation in which Executive
Board members retire at the same time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.341,r=0.286,b=0.511), with ID f5a56f2a-21d1-4aa2-81cd-047e7b268567 -->

Unlock the full potential of our people <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.023,r=0.417,b=0.065), with ID ff4d510c-1306-4535-8219-4b2ee51fe5b5 -->

Strengthening our winning culture

We continue to evolve and improve our culture across the business as an enabler of all aspects of our EverGreen strategy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.080,r=0.285,b=0.225), with ID 69d56b3c-1dc1-4347-82d6-765e9a5b31b1 -->

At our head office, where global functions converge,
fostering a strong, collaborative culture is vital. To
address the challenges of hybrid working, siloed
thinking and people with diverse experiences coming
together, we launched the Together We Thrive
Handshakes programme. Through focused two-hour
workshops, teams define and commit to a purpose,
principles and concrete ways of working. Since its
launch, nearly 1,300 people across more than 100
teams have participated, reporting improvements
in collaboration, wellbeing and work–life balance
as well as a stronger sense of identity across
head office. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.229,r=0.295,b=0.473), with ID 26e89f7b-2ac3-47cd-82dd-cf9453e4c371 -->

Elsewhere, we introduced the ‘Climate Winning Recipe’ initiative, a set of best practice guidelines designed to help management teams operate as one and inspire their people. By consolidating insights from operating companies worldwide into a clear and actionable ‘recipe’ format, the initiative builds trust, unity and shared purpose. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.477,r=0.295,b=0.617), with ID 41d82c3c-bf72-43cf-b5cc-9ed0628cfbbb -->

Though still in its early stages, the programme
reflects our commitment to empower our leaders to
build winning teams where everyone thrives. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.299,t=0.073,r=0.519,b=0.137), with ID b5c99b41-b217-48be-bddd-957acbe8c5d7 -->

These efforts contributed to a positive, healthy and future-ready culture, as reflected in our 2024 climate survey. With more than 74,000 employees across 85 operating companies participating, we achieved a 92% response rate. The results outperformed external benchmarks, with 90% of employees expressing pride in working at HEINEKEN and an employee engagement score of 86%. Further recognition came in October, when Forbes named us the world’s best employer in the food, beverages, alcohol and tobacco industry. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.140,r=0.523,b=0.351), with ID abaf1175-0c7d-4b4d-ac6b-594a9d0276fb -->

Talent and leadership development  
We’re committed to cultivating exceptional leaders that unlock the full potential of our people to deliver on our EverGreen strategy. In 2024, we took bold steps to expand and democratise access to formal leadership development programmes, scaling these initiatives to benefit more than 16,000 participants with a truly global offering. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.299,t=0.355,r=0.520,b=0.522), with ID a961ba0e-8354-4137-b209-1102d1794823 -->

Flagship programmes like the Heineken
International Management Course (HIMAC),
ACCELERATE and Women Interactive Network
(WIN) continued to equip senior and middle
managers with the skills they need to drive progress. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.073,r=0.747,b=0.174), with ID 0d54cfce-6125-4ed6-9163-2e40c6232808 -->

We launched two new initiatives in 2024: LEAD, our Global People Manager programme; and HEINEKEN’s Women’s Summit, a development programme for our senior female leaders.
Preparations were also underway for an additional offer. Having reflected on the successes of Thrive, an 18-month programme aimed at our top 160 leaders, Thrive Forward will take its learnings to management teams worldwide in 2025. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.177,r=0.749,b=0.350), with ID 6397f3d7-74f3-4032-bcfa-4a6da133131d -->

These initiatives are working. Our research suggests participants are 33% more likely to be retained in the business and twice as likely to be promoted versus peers. They’ve also earned external recognition, including two prestigious Brandon Hall Group Human Capital Management Excellence Awards: one for Best Learning Program Supporting a Change Transformation Business Strategy (HIMAC) and another for Best Leadership Development for Women (WIN). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.353,r=0.750,b=0.546), with ID d7c2e257-b9ae-41ca-99d0-4f66feaf68b7 -->

Unleashing diverse talent  
Nurturing an inclusive and equitable environment where all employees can thrive is good for our business as it helps make sure our brands reflect and communicate authentically with our diversifying consumer base. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.074,r=0.976,b=0.202), with ID dce9cc63-797b-4430-99b6-72072e92f651 -->

We launched Queenfisher in India, an initiative developed by an all-female team to celebrate sisterhood. Alongside a new beer with fresh packaging, we created safe spaces for honest conversations about female empowerment. Elsewhere, Strongbow took further steps towards becoming the UK’s most inclusive cider. Supporting the Heineken Open & Proud (HOP) network, it introduced Pride-inspired packaging and hosted activations that resonated with a new generation of diverse consumers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.205,r=0.976,b=0.414), with ID 20132a23-ae81-4076-a0af-d02c27649b5c -->

Meanwhile, 66% of management team roles in our operating companies are now held by local talent, demonstrating our focus on making sure teams reflect the markets, customers and consumers we serve. Cultural diversity is a cornerstone of our strategy, and a new global graduate programme is part of a range of efforts that are helping attract and develop the next generation of talent from increasingly diverse backgrounds. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.418,r=0.973,b=0.590), with ID 184f8a3b-1bf8-45ef-b44f-e106b1b9b401 -->

Lastly, advancing gender balance remains a key priority. Initiatives like WIN and Women in Sales are supporting our 2025 goal of 30% women in senior management one year ahead of schedule. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.594,r=0.975,b=0.674), with ID 40bdd709-fa9d-4c12-a8e0-b710dfe0d663 -->

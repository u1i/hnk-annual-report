“What began as a vision to decarbonise our operations is now starting to become a reality, thanks to the dedication of our teams and partners to innovative solutions. If all goes to plan, our Vialonga brewery will reach 100% renewable energy in production by 2030 – a major ambition for us in Portugal.”

We recognise that our activities have both negative and positive impacts on the environment and society. Since 2021, our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy has been the foundation for driving progress towards a net zero, fairer and more balanced world. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.648,t=0.257,r=0.970,b=0.413), with ID 930af49f-2c5a-4d38-aedc-cbdf616e9212 -->

As we achieved some of our 2023 goals, we refined our approach. We remain focused on our three pillars – Environmental, Social and Responsible, and continue working within our business and across our value chain to drive transformational and long-term change. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.649,t=0.419,r=0.970,b=0.575), with ID 5c32f919-18e3-4870-bc43-9e4bc4224766 -->

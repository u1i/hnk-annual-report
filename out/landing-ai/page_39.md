Internal control  
HEINEKEN’s internal control activities aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of internal processes with regards to the accuracy of financial information, non-financial disclosures, and the Company’s compliance with applicable laws and internal policies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.078,r=0.292,b=0.220), with ID 90263a5b-c928-4ade-bb5f-41cfc263d022 -->

Internal controls have been defined at operating
entity level (HEINEKEN Rules – comprising all
mandatory standards and procedures) and at
process level (Process and Control Standards) for key
processes, including financial and non-financial
reporting, IT and Tax. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.226,r=0.293,b=0.342), with ID 208bd66e-2bcd-4be6-836c-cd43d7aa1769 -->

Compliance with company policies is periodically assessed. Deviations from the defined standards are included in the global monitoring and follow-up processes, supporting management in addressing these deviations. Management is responsible for the definition and timely implementation of action plans to remediate any deficiency identified as part of these assessments. The results are reported to the Executive Board. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.347,r=0.292,b=0.516), with ID c17a1b21-87e3-4824-a1cc-fabf32960876 -->

The HEINEKEN Rules, policies and controls are
periodically updated to reflect both the Company
key risks and the extent to which the Company is
willing and able to mitigate them. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.522,r=0.283,b=0.604), with ID 08934841-c273-4ba0-ac57-29fc8b567301 -->

Risk Committee  
The Executive Board of HEINEKEN is accountable for risk management, risk oversight and the protection of HEINEKEN’s reputation, value of assets and brands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.610,r=0.294,b=0.715), with ID 704dbac4-c0e7-4310-a672-0b280b183542 -->

The Board is assisted by the Risk Committee, chaired by the CFO, in regular reviews of the Group risk assessment cycle that summarises the Company’s key risks, associated mitigating actions and monitoring activities. These reviews consider the level of risk that HEINEKEN is willing to take and the type of HEINEKEN’s objectives it impacts. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.720,r=0.294,b=0.856), with ID 0674a671-b016-4611-82c7-1d468a562099 -->

The Risk Committee identifies changes to the
Company’s risk exposure and proposes interventions
if required. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.860,r=0.293,b=0.922), with ID 26624f56-af0a-42c8-9366-c0b147d9c250 -->

Organisation
For the organisation of risk management activities, HEINEKEN applies a ‘three lines of defence’ model. First and most important is the quality and behaviour of operational management, the first line of defence. They have the ownership, responsibility and accountability for assessing and mitigating risks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.077,r=0.521,b=0.221), with ID 7d2cb360-d49d-4f32-8a8a-0fe40ffe7a0a -->

Operational management is supported by the
second line of defence, functions that oversee
compliance with HEINEKEN’s policies, processes and
controls, facilitate the implementation of risk
management practices and drive continuous
improvements of internal controls. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.226,r=0.520,b=0.341), with ID 3da6cba0-391d-4fff-a465-64cfac4778ed -->

As third line of defence, the internal audit function (Global Audit) is mandated to perform Group-wide reviews of key processes, projects and systems, based on HEINEKEN’s strategic priorities and most significant risk areas. Global Audit provides independent and objective assurance and consultancy services. It employs a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the organisation’s governance and risk management process including reliability of information, compliance with laws, regulations and procedures, and efficient and effective use of resources. The methodology followed by Global Audit is in accordance with the standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.346,r=0.514,b=0.626), with ID 0583bcd2-158c-4738-9170-87ada97bb50f -->

To support the Executive Board’s external representations, a formal bi-annual Letter of Representation process is in place. It requires management to take responsibility for accurate and complete reporting on financial and non-financial reporting disclosures, financial reporting controls and on compliance with the Code of Conduct and other HEINEKEN Rules, as well as identifying and reporting on fraud and irregularities. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.632,r=0.523,b=0.805), with ID e52ac75a-a393-4e47-bdb6-793977f31960 -->

Processes
HEINEKEN’s risk management activities seek to identify and appropriately address any significant threat to the achievement of the Company’s strategy and business objectives, its reputation and the continuity of its operations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.077,r=0.744,b=0.202), with ID 70d2221d-74c5-4532-b722-ed77f09bb389 -->

HEINEKEN’s risk management system enables management to identify, assess, prioritise and manage risks on a continuous and systematic basis, and covers all subsidiaries across regions, countries, markets and corporate functions. Ongoing identification and assessment of risks, including new risks arising from changes in the global or local business environment, are part of HEINEKEN’s planning, performance and risk management cycles. Risk assessments are performed by every subsidiary and all global functions. The implementation of responses and progress of risk mitigating measures is monitored on a quarterly basis. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.207,r=0.748,b=0.452), with ID 22bb6f4c-a901-4d8e-aae2-66888cf9aac2 -->

Risk assessment outcomes are aggregated at a global level and serve as basis for determining HEINEKEN’s risk exposure and risk management priorities by the Risk Committee. Accountability for mitigating, monitoring and reporting on the most significant risks is assigned to functional directors who report on progress and residual risk levels three times per year to the Risk Committee. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.457,r=0.744,b=0.609), with ID 55bf6fa5-4d33-4c3f-abcd-7da67972210a -->

HEINEKEN continues to evolve risk management in the Company, reflecting new and emerging risks. Building on the existing risk and controls mechanisms, improvements are aimed at driving business ownership of risks, increasing business involvement in risk management and expanding the integrated view of risks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.614,r=0.750,b=0.749), with ID 87c20426-504c-45a0-a1cb-1f67ddafcc64 -->

This is not a full overview of all risks and uncertainties
that may affect the Company. As new risks emerge
and existing immaterial risks evolve, timely discovery
and accurate evaluation of risks are at the core of
HEINEKEN’s risk management system. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.171,r=0.977,b=0.268), with ID e4a97626-e689-48c2-8937-3adfeb17e4a6 -->

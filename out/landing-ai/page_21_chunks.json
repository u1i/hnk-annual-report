We shared best practices from the programme on our global platform, enabling production sites to learn, share and reapply them within the Company. Advanced technologies and water treatment optimisation are also delivering results across many sites, including in Mexico and Ethiopia. In Myanmar, a shift in water treatment saved around 1.0 hl/hl, and in Cambodia adjusting the source of water withdrawal delivered a 0.4 hl/hl reduction in water use.",

  • The group is dressed in business or business-casual attire, including suits, blazers, dress shirts, and dress shoes.
  • The composition is balanced, with some people standing, some sitting on bar stools, and others leaning against the counter.
  • Lighting is bright and even, highlighting the subjects and the modern interior.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement references.
  • The Heineken logo is prominently displayed above the bar area.
  • Glassware and beer taps are visible on the bar counter.
  • Some on-image text at the top (partially visible) includes “President, Americas” and “Member Executive Board and CFO”.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The group is distributed across the foreground, with the bar counter forming a central horizontal axis.
  • Individuals are spaced evenly, with some overlap in posture (e.g., leaning, sitting).

# Responsible

## A consumer-centric approach on the path to moderation and no harmful use

Beer is a beverage that, when enjoyed in moderation, can be part of a balanced lifestyle. However, when alcohol is not consumed responsibly there are clear health and behavioural risks. That is why we have always been committed to advocating for responsible consumption and supporting efforts to address harmful consumption. We aim to lead the debate on responsible consumption and support actions that decrease harmful consumption. Our purpose is to brew the joy of true togetherness, and we believe that drinking in moderation is the best way to experience that joy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.087,r=0.295,b=0.431), with ID 4e646240-580e-49ee-b9ae-4cbc281ab311 -->

In 2024, we launched our company moderation mantra: Low. Slow. No. This mantra focuses on providing information on ‘low’ alcohol intake, encouraging ‘slow’ and moderate consumption, and expanding ‘no’ alcohol options to give consumers greater choice. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.434,r=0.293,b=0.553), with ID 71de0494-45ea-48e6-87d2-44f72e2eba49 -->

Always a choice  
The future of socialising is undergoing a shift as the trend towards moderation continues in markets around the world. Young adults are transforming the social drinking landscape, contributing to the rise in non-alcoholic beverages. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.076,r=0.522,b=0.201), with ID 61709ce7-62c1-40d3-87c8-8ace92368e79 -->

We are giving consumers more choice with our 0.0 portfolio of beer and cider brands and empowering them with clear and transparent information. As the leader in the low- and no-alcohol category, we have been investing and innovating since 2017 to fuel increasing demand for alcohol-free alternatives, tackling the stigmas around social acceptance of choosing low- and no-alcohol beverages. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.205,r=0.519,b=0.359), with ID 6757e9ac-227a-4064-a4dd-c8202ce16c1b -->

Our goal is to always provide consumers with a choice, by offering a 0.0 line extension of our strategic brands in the majority of our markets, led by our global brand Heineken® 0.0, available in 117 markets with launches in 3 markets in 2024. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.363,r=0.518,b=0.462), with ID 77832189-7289-4d4b-a784-e29ff2f2b7ec -->

We aim to have a zero alcohol option for one strategic brand in the majority of our markets (accounting for 90% of our business by volume) by 2025. In 2024, operating companies with a zero alcohol option for one strategic brand represented 91% of our total beer and cider volume. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.465,r=0.516,b=0.584), with ID 1573951c-60b9-4404-8870-856e66a8a14a -->

El Aguila is the fifth strategic brand of HEINEKEN
Spain that launched a zero alcohol option, bringing
the total number of 0.0 options that we offer our
Spanish consumers to twelve. El Águila Sin Filtrar
0.0 is a groundbreaking zero alcohol beer that
exemplifies our dedication to innovation and always
providing a choice with our expanding no-
alcohol portfolio. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.073,r=0.748,b=0.230), with ID c20777bc-99fc-4dfc-9c48-8d892ae2eded -->

Consumer transparency
Providing a choice is also about giving people the right information in an accessible way. We advocate for consumer transparency so that people can make an informed choice about our products. Our labels include on-pack information about ingredients, nutrition, calories, alcohol by volume, allergens and packaging recycling symbols. In terms of responsible drinking, consumers are informed with on-pack pictograms not to drink and drive, not to drink underage and not to drink during pregnancy. This is complemented with a QR code linking to further information on alcohol and health. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.234,r=0.748,b=0.481), with ID 097c9eb2-688e-4589-a998-bc149a4fb875 -->

Our goal is to provide clear and transparent consumer information on 100% of our products by 2024. The goal was defined to allow enough time for operating companies to manage the labelling transition in a sustainable way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.484,r=0.746,b=0.584), with ID dfbb9db8-d64b-4f7c-9ccd-def4c69ccc3f -->

By the end of 2024, all markets except HEINEKEN Brazil had clear and transparent consumer information on their products in scope. As a result, 83% of our products had labels that fully meet our criteria (2023: 53%). By the first quarter of 2025, HEINEKEN Brazil’s labelling stock will have been used and their products will contain all the required information. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.073,r=0.976,b=0.211), with ID b0aea792-7a98-4597-a2b3-6bfd1ab6d0ea -->

Partnerships to address harmful use of alcohol
Addressing harmful alcohol use is a critical priority. Harmful patterns of alcohol consumption pose substantial health and social risks, making responsible drinking practices essential to our approach. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.215,r=0.976,b=0.315), with ID 38f51b1d-0bd0-409a-ae2a-9a994170a67f -->

We aim to foster responsible practices and support initiatives that reduce harmful drinking worldwide. Our goal is to engage in partnerships that contribute to reducing the harmful use of alcohol in 100% of markets every year. In 2024, 100% of our markets in scope had a partnership in place, making this the third consecutive year in which we met our goal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.318,r=0.977,b=0.454), with ID 3381c976-ddcf-4afc-9e84-5a15d49b7a58 -->

In South Africa, we are partnering with the NGO ‘I CAN 4 IR’ to tackle harmful use of alcohol at targeted vocational colleges and provide vital referral support for those in need. This educational programme aims to reach 5,000 students, empowering them to make responsible drinking choices and fostering a culture of safety and awareness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.458,r=0.978,b=0.594), with ID 0d07a153-e249-4c0b-b160-0358b06bed09 -->

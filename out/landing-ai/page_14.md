Desperados – the beer with Latin vibe  
Desperados is a unique product that offers the spirit of experimentation, spontaneity and self-expression, engaging with young consumers across more than 30 markets globally. In 2024, the brand embarked on a review of its DNA to ensure even greater relevance with Gen Z audiences and enhance consistency across its markets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.076,r=0.291,b=0.237), with ID 8dd025c9-12a6-41ba-ae4d-3f6e65b5b1a3 -->

This reflection culminated in a bold new positioning, The Beer with a Latin Vibe, set to launch in January 2025. Inspired by the belief that a life constrained is a life unlived, the positioning will come to fruition through a complete brand reset (campaign, visual identity, below the line, experiential and innovation) igniting moments of connection and celebration. This reset will tap into a series of culturally relevant passion points, empowering Gen Z to sidestep life's uncertainties and live it to the full. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.244,r=0.291,b=0.432), with ID ebf48566-c956-4195-86ec-37d149ecc59a -->

The new positioning will deepen connections with Gen Z and pave the way for new consumer recruitment across the HEINEKEN portfolio. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.075,r=0.509,b=0.140), with ID cd25526c-e2ea-408f-8019-33f5d563dd25 -->

Sol – sun-powered positivity  
Sol spreads positivity and brightens the world with optimism, encouraging carefree enjoyment since 1899. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.149,r=0.506,b=0.235), with ID d672a162-5897-4637-b309-c9e4012f5b52 -->

Present in over 50 markets, Sol continued to shine in 2024, achieving single-digit growth outside its home market of Mexico and strong performance in Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Colombia. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.242,r=0.519,b=0.319), with ID 035ef8f2-9d14-4f86-96de-f9b7bb2a5762 -->

Innovation played a key role, with the launch of Sol 0.0% in Brazil – a no-alcohol beer enriched with vitamins for health-conscious consumers – and Sol Mix, a range of cocktail-inspired flavoured lagers, in Chile. In Mexico, Sol Mezclas now leads the flavoured beer category. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.326,r=0.522,b=0.442), with ID dc8671f5-5f60-41a2-9b59-2e6ff6158320 -->

Alongside these innovations, the brand is refreshing its visual identity with a bold, legacy-inspired design, starting in South Africa and set for a global roll-out in 2025. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.075,r=0.742,b=0.153), with ID 91de012c-4558-4fd8-906c-4dec5316c2e9 -->

With a new campaign launching in 2025, Sol is poised to strengthen its connection with consumers by offering vibrant, versatile experiences that meet the evolving demands of modern beer drinkers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.160,r=0.741,b=0.240), with ID 070da0c3-fb1b-44ec-bb68-841ae2269560 -->

Pioneering choice in
low and no-alcohol

The drivers of moderation are evolving. As wellbeing becomes more holistic, positive and lifestyle-oriented, consumers want choices that align with diverse needs and occasions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.258,r=0.746,b=0.405), with ID 193002e8-d82c-45bb-b914-96070e071ac5 -->

The 0.0 beer category is one of the fastest-growing, expanding at 5% annually over the past five years. HEINEKEN leads the way, shaping and driving the category’s growth. Now available in 117 countries, Heineken® 0.0 is the global leader in the low and no-alcohol space. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.411,r=0.747,b=0.527), with ID c1c83e79-7144-4f74-b76d-d916c56e87ba -->

We continued to drive growth for Heineken® 0.0 across 2024, building engagement with consumers through communications, sponsorships and heavyweight media investment. Evidence of our commitment and belief in the category is the ongoing wide-scale roll-out of 0.0 on draught in Spain, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland. A significant driver in the democratisation of non-alcoholic beer, this is breaking down lingering stigma and boosting accessibility. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.074,r=0.974,b=0.264), with ID 2a5d908f-668d-4cd9-9249-468147069252 -->

Elsewhere, innovation continued to fuel our portfolio. In Poland, Żywiec 0.0, HEINEKEN’s third-largest 0.0 brand, grew by 36% in 2024, driven by its botanical flavoured zero range, which nearly doubled volumes with raspberry and mint line extensions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.271,r=0.975,b=0.368), with ID 44a75533-a698-4b99-b617-e0fa3322060b -->

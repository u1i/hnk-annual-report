Digitalising our route to consumer

HEINEKEN has cherished its relationships with customers and consumers for more than 150 years. In a world where customers expect instant, personalised service online and consumers demand Netflix-style experiences across their interactions with all brands, we’re building new digital capabilities to keep these connections strong. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.087,r=0.295,b=0.298), with ID 5be36f1f-cd9d-4ad3-a568-6c6108f1e51f -->

This involves developing innovative online platforms for customers and embracing new digital consumer engagement models. Crucially, this digitisation journey is giving us access to better, richer data that we’re using to further improve our service, optimise engagement and empower growth. While this journey is far from over, 2024 was a pivotal year. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.301,r=0.293,b=0.441), with ID 1339707e-0436-4618-a8ec-d49e6bcfb02e -->

Revolutionising customer engagement
In 2024, we continued to put our customers at the centre of everything we do, reimagining how they interact with us across every touchpoint: through eB2B platforms, sales representatives, customer service agents and distributors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.076,r=0.518,b=0.201), with ID 3ed4fb76-bce4-406c-8c43-e40b0d45469a -->

‘eazle’, the brand name and identity for our eB2B platforms, aims to make our customers’ business easy. As part of our journey to create an integrated, end-to-end platform across all key touchpoints and reimagine the customer experience, eazle has so far been launched in four markets. The approach is already bearing fruit: over the course of 2024, the platform achieved close to €13 billion in gross merchandise value, connecting with 670,867 active customers and accounting for 70% of fragmented trade revenue – up from 60% in 2023. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.204,r=0.519,b=0.415), with ID 8f05cd03-1d5b-42a1-8dba-637175dd5225 -->

Crucially, our success in driving up the number of customers engaging with us through digital channels is supporting the acceleration of wider data-driven innovation to deliver better service for customers and growth for HEINEKEN. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.073,r=0.750,b=0.172), with ID a5211a66-af61-47a3-8939-51c84ecf05f6 -->

Beyond engagement, we continued to pioneer
smart solutions to drive efficiencies for both
customers and our business. Experiments with
connected outlets allowed us to automate stock
replenishment in bars, while continued investment in
shelf image recognition technology is helping
retailers optimise their inventory. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.178,r=0.749,b=0.313), with ID 9caf96c8-03b6-4e1d-acbd-77bb22323ddc -->

Our digitisation of customer experience is
dramatically improving our customer relationships.
Our customer NPS scores have increased steadily
over the years to 68 in 2024. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.317,r=0.743,b=0.398), with ID 50cd1f8f-1605-4414-8888-c0816f950cf9 -->

Deepening consumer connections
Alongside our customer initiatives, we’re harnessing digital innovation to help create richer, more meaningful and personalised experiences for consumers – and deliver growth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.075,r=0.973,b=0.183), with ID 98b6461f-daae-4f5c-9752-975638cd34e4 -->

In 2024, we supported our brand teams in launching consumer-facing applications that resonate with our diverse global audiences. The Player 0.0 app, for example, embedded HEINEKEN in the gaming community by leveraging our ambassador Max Verstappen through our Formula 1 campaign. Elsewhere, Hei! helped consumers in cities organise social events effortlessly and discover new experiences and venues. Initiatives such as these not only delivered brand growth, but also generated valuable first-party consumer data that we use to optimise media spend and marketing activations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.188,r=0.978,b=0.415), with ID 45aa4572-fb50-4eda-addf-4434eb359dea -->

As we digitise, our stakeholders’ privacy is our priority.
We have continued to invest in providing the
necessary privacy protection around our consumers
and their data in all our markets. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.419,r=0.978,b=0.498), with ID 047c7a84-bb1d-4bea-a763-9640fca54293 -->

While global monetary policy may start to ease, structural shifts in industries, and reduction in real disposable income and consumer sentiment may lead to a prolonged recession of the global economy, decline in consumer spending and adverse movement in exchange rates. Public debt, the disruption of global value chains and barriers to the cross-border movement of people and goods are other key risk factors.

Unlocking
profitable growth

Driven by its size and increasing
demand in some key markets, the
Americas presents a unique
opportunity for us. We’re strengthening
our competitive position by scaling
premiumisation led by Heineken®,
accelerating innovation, digitising our
route-to-consumer and other strategic
investments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.077,r=0.293,b=0.364), with ID a09215af-68c2-4bb0-bdba-86aefae045e0 -->

Exceptional performance  
Despite high inflation, currency devaluation in Mexico and Brazil, instability in Haiti and Ecuador, and reduced consumer purchasing power in the US, HEINEKEN Americas delivered exceptional performance in 2024. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.374,r=0.290,b=0.498), with ID 45749728-374c-4f05-bfa0-3239e4e802d4 -->

Our premiumisation strategy continued to drive strong results, with the Heineken® brand leading with high single-digit growth. Amstel® also showed impressive high single-digit growth, with particularly strong results in Brazil and Ecuador. In Panama, Cristal reinforced its position as a differentiated premium brand. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.504,r=0.290,b=0.638), with ID 538d0ade-bca7-45d2-acd4-1636484aee5d -->

Summary : This is a close-up photograph showing two Heineken cans with a tennis-themed design placed among several bright yellow tennis balls inside a wire basket, likely on a tennis court.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subjects are two tall Heineken cans with a special tennis-themed design.
  • The cans are placed diagonally among numerous fluorescent yellow tennis balls.
  • The setting appears to be a tennis court, as indicated by the visible court surface and the wire basket.
  • The can design features the word "LLOOOVVVEE" in stacked white letters, a green tennis ball graphic, and the Heineken logo at the bottom.
  • Lighting is bright and even, suggesting an outdoor or well-lit indoor environment.
  • Colour palette is dominated by green (cans, court), yellow (tennis balls), and blue (court surface).

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification; objects are shown at life size.
  • Visible text on cans: "LLOOOVVVEE" and "Heineken".
  • No on-image UI elements.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The two cans are centrally placed, leaning against each other at an angle.
  • Tennis balls fill the basket, surrounding the cans in the foreground and background.
  • The basket is positioned at an angle, with the court surface visible in the background.

Analysis :
  • The image visually associates Heineken with tennis, likely as part of a promotional campaign or event.
  • The repetition of "LLOOOVVVEE" mimics tennis scoring terminology ("love" meaning zero) and emphasizes the tennis theme.
  • The composition draws attention to the branded cans, making them the focal point amid the tennis balls. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.077,t=0.701,r=0.306,b=0.964), with ID 1e177e0a-3697-45a0-9a2a-988a82224e41 -->

Innovating in beer and beyond
We continued expanding our portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences. Heineken® Silver, our fresh, world-class light beer, is delivering encouraging results and promising progress in Panama and South America. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.076,r=0.508,b=0.200), with ID 562baffd-6aca-47f2-8b72-7b36c9b346cd -->

In the RTD segment, Amstel Vibes demonstrated
strong momentum in Brazil, while Rum Stripe, Piton
Vibes and Ricardo gained traction in the Caribbean.
Our non-alcoholic beverage portfolio in Brazil
achieved remarkable growth, driven by FYS, our
low-sugar soft drink. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.207,r=0.515,b=0.320), with ID 609359bf-df13-466a-adc0-a85f90a02210 -->

Making meaningful connections with consumers
remained a priority. The UEFA Champions League
and Formula 1 were key platforms once again:
Heineken® activations such as Chec0.0 Perez in
Mexico and Senna in Brazil shared the brand’s spirit
with local audiences. In Jamaica, a partnership with
Usain Bolt highlighted Red Stripe’s connection to the
island. Our campaigns were once again recognised
at Cannes, with the Americas earning five Lions for
The Gaming Fridge (Brazil), Out of Home Matches
(Brazil), Backing the Bars (Brazil and Argentina) and
0.0 Prohibition (Argentina). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.327,r=0.518,b=0.551), with ID 0a7d20a0-c087-4771-8c3d-2d1ac1240d80 -->

Investing in growth
We made a range of strategic investments. In Mexico, the Meoqui Can Factory became operational in June, a key milestone in supply chain integration. In Brazil, we advanced construction of the Passos brewery, set to become one of our most sustainable facilities in the region. And in Panama, brewery upgrades enabled local production of Heineken® to begin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.077,r=0.748,b=0.237), with ID 07ab20e8-09cf-4d7c-bcf8-3d23bebb079b -->

We also made significant progress on our digital journey, with a growing share of fragmented trade revenue now coming through digital channels. As of 2024, more than two thirds of customers use our digital platforms, reflecting the impact of this transformation programme on our business. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.243,r=0.743,b=0.358), with ID 627d956a-22f7-4875-9b1e-095b4a9bb0fb -->

“We continued to grow in the Americas through premiumisation, innovation and strategic investments.

Always a choice  
Our low and no-alcohol portfolio continues to achieve double-digit growth, led by Heineken® 0.0, now available in all our 14 operating companies and eight export markets, and Tecate 0.0. In Brazil, we launched Sol Zero, a no-alcohol beer enriched with vitamins D and B. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.076,r=0.974,b=0.219), with ID e7486adc-9429-4750-9969-a05db739dbb9 -->

Sustainability
In Brazil, SPIN, an innovative partnership ecosystem, was launched to drive sustainable models for packaging circularity, regenerative agriculture, energy transition and impact brands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.349,r=0.973,b=0.453), with ID f4c9720c-a7fd-4428-a7ce-0d067bd34250 -->

The roll-out of our decarbonisation programme gained momentum, with Suriname, Peru and Lagunitas transitioning to 100% renewable electricity. A new PPA contract for a wind farm in Bahia State, Brazil, solar projects, biomethane adoption, biomass boiler installations and vehicle electrification initiatives all demonstrated our ambition to scale renewable energy. Water stewardship also improved, with water efficiency reaching record low levels. New water reclamation plants in Mexico and Brazil neared completion. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.757,t=0.461,r=0.964,b=0.666), with ID 5493bb51-ccdb-472b-8679-7e6c39c92016 -->

We remain focused on diversifying leadership, building talent pipeline and fostering inclusivity. Our leadership development programmes are equipping colleagues with career opportunities and supporting the delivery of our EverGreen strategy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.757,t=0.673,r=0.973,b=0.769), with ID ce0bbab1-4076-4937-bfa4-a83ad8f342d5 -->

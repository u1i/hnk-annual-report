# Financial review

## Operating profit

Operating profit landed at €3.5 billion (2023: €3.2 billion), higher than previous year due to strong organic profit growth and lower exceptional items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.024,r=0.510,b=0.147), with ID 2b0d799c-9df6-442b-87ec-5eef7a368cc2 -->

Operating profit (beia) grew organically by 8.3% with growth delivered across all four regions. Improved portfolio mix, pricing, and productivity savings more than offset inflationary pressures in our cost base and funded incremental investments to support the power of our brands and our digitalisation and sustainability agendas. Currency translation negatively impacted operating profit (beia) by €236 million, or 5.3%, mainly due to the devaluation of currencies in emerging markets particularly the Nigerian Naira. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.151,r=0.519,b=0.251), with ID 3eff52cf-2057-45ad-b997-57c90252ff90 -->

waterfall chart:
# Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title shown.
  • X-axis: Sequential categories—FY 2023 Operating profit beia, Organic growth, Currency translation, Consolidation impact, FY 2024 Operating profit beia, Eia, FY 2024 Operating profit IFRS.
  • Y-axis: Not explicitly labeled; values are in numeric units (likely millions).

# Data Points :
  • FY 2023 Operating profit beia: 4,443
  • Organic growth: +367
  • Currency translation: –236
  • Consolidation impact: –62
  • FY 2024 Operating profit beia: 4,512
  • Eia: –995
  • FY 2024 Operating profit IFRS: 3,517

# Design Encodings :
  • Positive values (bars) shown in dark green; adjustments (organic growth, Eia) in light green.
  • Negative adjustments (currency translation, consolidation impact) shown as negative values in parentheses.
  • Sequential left-to-right layout, with each step building on the previous total.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • The chart starts at 4,443 and ends at 3,517.
  • Organic growth is positive, but currency translation and consolidation impact are negative.
  • Eia adjustment is a large negative value before arriving at the final IFRS profit.

# Analysis :
  • Operating profit beia increased slightly from FY 2023 to FY 2024 (from 4,443 to 4,512), mainly due to organic growth, partially offset by negative currency and consolidation impacts.
  • The Eia adjustment is a significant negative factor, reducing the FY 2024 profit from 4,512 (beia) to 3,517 (IFRS).
  • The largest single negative adjustment is the Eia, while organic growth is the main positive contributor. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.283,r=0.513,b=0.430), with ID bb19c3e5-c4e5-469c-8819-503536462c0f -->

Net finance expenses  
Net interest expenses increased 3.6% to €570 million (2023: €550 million).

Net interest expenses (beia) increased organically by 12.7% to €543 million primarily due to higher interest expenses in Nigeria. The average effective interest rate (beia) in 2024 was 3.5% (2023: 3.4%). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.441,r=0.513,b=0.540), with ID e134b9c2-f01b-4f26-b718-498a493229c4 -->

Other net finance expenses decreased by 37.3% to €235 million (2023: €375 million). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.543,r=0.429,b=0.570), with ID c3b3e49c-215c-494a-9dd6-782ba6b10375 -->

Other net finance expenses (beia) increased organically by 12.1% to €271 million, mainly caused by transactional foreign currency effects resulting from the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira and Ethiopian Birr, and depreciation of the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.572,r=0.522,b=0.635), with ID 2ceb077d-d378-44af-8290-a2f7e45f905c -->

Share of profit of associates and joint ventures  
The share of profit of associates and joint ventures decreased to a loss of €705 million (2023: €218 million profit) and includes the attributable profit from China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co. Ltd. (CR Beer) with a two-month delay (November 2023 to October 2024) and the impairment of €874 million of HEINEKEN's investment in CR Beer taken during the first half of this year. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.642,r=0.514,b=0.749), with ID 9a81cf0e-3e15-41aa-88c6-7785e27143ae -->

Share of profit of associates and joint ventures (beia) amounted to €312 million, an organic increase of 16.7% reflecting the strong profit growth of our associate and joint venture partners in Chile, Costa Rica, and China. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.751,r=0.523,b=0.798), with ID 6758cc13-8246-4ad3-975a-bed495751e86 -->

Income tax expense  
Total income tax expense increased from €121 million in 2023 to €846 million in 2024. As a result, the reported effective tax rate increased from 5.2% to 31.2%. Last year’s income tax expense included a significant one-off benefit for the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets in Brazil. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.804,r=0.497,b=0.893), with ID 9b9b9e6a-46c5-4cd0-b137-f1e672814a8a -->

The effective tax rate (beia) was 27.9% (2023: 26.8%). The increase is primarily due to the tax law changes in Brazil that came into effect on 1 January 2024. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.895,r=0.515,b=0.939), with ID da586523-fd64-4804-ac90-5db66af5cd0c -->

Net profit

Net profit was €1.0 billion (2023: €2.3 billion). The decrease is due to the impact of exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition related intangibles on net profit which increased to €1,761 million (2023: €329 million), mainly caused by the non-cash impairment of our investment in China Resources Beer in the first half of the year. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.074,r=0.967,b=0.183), with ID 376906b5-516b-4a52-8b26-6ab0c18ce67e -->

Net profit (beia) increased organically 7.3% to €2.7 billion (2023: €2.6 billion), with the growth coming mainly from the strong performance in operating profit. Higher profits from associates and joint ventures including CCU in Chile, FIFCO in Costa Rica, and China Resources Beer, were more than offset by higher financing and tax expenses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.188,r=0.976,b=0.267), with ID 05757e56-b444-491e-b126-fdf026edeab5 -->

Earnings per share – diluted

Earnings per share – diluted decreased to 1.74 (2023: 4.09). Earnings per share – diluted (beia) decreased by 4.7% from €4.67 to €4.89. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.275,r=0.975,b=0.345), with ID 7b3be7cb-87b4-4c21-a174-99c810cb9745 -->

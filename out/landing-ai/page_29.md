# Building a modern Digital Backbone

HEINEKEN is on a journey to become the world’s best-connected brewer, powered by a cutting-edge Digital Backbone. This transformation replaces our previously fragmented technology landscape with a modern, modular architecture that combines a lean Digital CORE with standardised cloud-based platforms. The resulting industry-leading technology enables new ways of working, enhanced customer service, end-to-end efficiencies and rapid scaling of capabilities globally – all the while staying agile for future innovation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.079,r=0.293,b=0.371), with ID 4a233ba3-ff78-4a34-9200-3c30f2d5d422 -->

2024 was a pivotal year marked by the successful deployment of pilots in three operating companies. These pilots tested the integration of all 35 of our Digital Backbone applications across diverse business models, markets and tech starting points. In our pilot operating company, the system exceeded expectations, going live without disruption. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.375,r=0.295,b=0.512), with ID b7937d30-0adb-4a47-a030-f9b79acad8ae -->

Within two months, the operating company achieved record-breaking sales and production, underscoring the system’s potential to boost efficiency and performance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.515,r=0.277,b=0.596), with ID ae5a6f0f-b9a1-434d-ac69-a955ced82c29 -->

User feedback post-launch reinforced the positive impact of the new architecture’s experience. Similar outcomes followed in Serbia and Egypt, solidifying the Digital Backbone’s readiness for broader implementation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.074,r=0.511,b=0.173), with ID 029f05c7-efa2-4292-b37b-49cf69b159ee -->

With our consolidated future digital landscape in mind, we’ve stepped up our cybersecurity and system resilience to make sure we’re best placed to protect the business against ever-increasing global digital threats. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.177,r=0.515,b=0.277), with ID f5ae76e3-a274-4aa2-b56a-38b2febe0900 -->

# Creating a digitally enabled organisation

It’s crucial that we have the right skills and capabilities both within our global Digital and Technology function and across all of HEINEKEN. In 2024, we continued to step up these capabilities, empowering teams with skills and tools that enable an agile, future-fit business. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.294,r=0.519,b=0.487), with ID 527267f2-869d-4217-aa6b-acaa9f01f139 -->

Our global digital hubs are at the heart of this transformation, serving as engines of innovation and delivery. These hubs ensure consistent, cost-effective implementation of capabilities across our operating companies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.491,r=0.524,b=0.593), with ID 1f931af3-bd98-4448-a35b-95e16e8fb630 -->

This year we began to set up a global Commerce DevOps hub to support our strategic e-commerce operations and a Technology Platforms & Sourcing Hub for Europe in Krakow. We also enhanced existing hubs with additional capabilities, including Data & Analytics, for example. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.527,t=0.073,r=0.744,b=0.192), with ID 3fca328c-e83f-4e8b-a330-b9283b3383ff -->

We also formally established and expanded Tiger Tribe, our global innovation and digital product development team, at our hub in Ho Chi Minh City. Our ‘Tigers’ collaborate with internal and external partners to address critical business challenges, from enhancing customer experience to optimising supply chains. The team is a game changer for HEINEKEN and is already leveraging GenAI to deliver product development and innovation cost-effectively at speed and scale. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.196,r=0.749,b=0.386), with ID 25695f4b-873e-4505-82f3-763e4b3ba778 -->

By the end of 2024, our hubs were powered by more than 700 tech-specialists, up from 20 in 2021. This remarkable growth underscores our commitment to creating a digitally enabled organisation that attracts, develops and retains diverse talents within HEINEKEN’s Digital and Technology function. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.390,r=0.749,b=0.509), with ID e157a2af-d819-48ee-a8ca-e7b492364dac -->

Shareholders' equity decreased by €475 million to 19,581 million, mainly driven by the net profit of €978 million offset by the negative other comprehensive income of €472 million, and dividend payments to shareholders of €969 million. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.641,r=0.961,b=0.703), with ID 5b05fe40-a8f4-4bcf-bd35-04e032ca79c5 -->

Total borrowings amounted to €17,049 million (2023: €18,238 million). Net debt decreased to €14,651 million (2023: €15,835 million) as the strong free operating cash flow exceeded dividend payments and negative foreign currency effects on net debt. Including the effect of cross-currency swaps, 77% of net debt is Euro-denominated, and 12% is US dollar and US dollar proxy currencies. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.707,r=0.977,b=0.788), with ID fcd62ca0-e8d7-4cb8-a582-0ae0f7e70377 -->

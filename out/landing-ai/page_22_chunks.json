We are strengthening our pipeline of women talent below senior management levels and ensuring performance based fair and equal opportunities in attracting, developing and promoting talent.

We first achieved our goal of having 100% of our operating companies assessed and 100% action plans in place in 2023. In 2024, we continued to assess all operating companies and to track action plans to close any pay gaps. We also focused on ensuring equal representation, addressing new hires and opportunities for promotion. Actions included embedding structural checks and controls in processes to drive gender-neutral pay decisions. These efforts resulted in a pay gap of 2.3% in favour of men at the global level in 2024. This figure is significantly lower than the 5% threshold established by the EU Pay Transparency Directive and is in line with other industry leaders in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector.",

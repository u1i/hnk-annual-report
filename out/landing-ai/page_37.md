Shaping the future of beer and beyond

Despite a challenging market, we strengthened our position in Europe over 2024 by investing in our brands and driving innovation across our portfolio. From transforming our supply chain to enhancing digital capabilities, we’re delivering on our strategy to grow, win and transform. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.077,r=0.293,b=0.387), with ID 314157e8-0fa9-4036-9617-a5d00e282333 -->

Driving growth and winning
amid headwinds
After a solid start to 2024, we faced a challenging summer marked by a slowdown in consumer demand, adverse weather and competitive pressures. We began to regain momentum over the second half of the year, however. Improved competitiveness drove volume growth, while Q3 share gains signalled a shift to stronger performance, particularly in the off-trade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.394,r=0.291,b=0.595), with ID 857ebd00-b2ac-41b5-babc-849842bd6c45 -->

The prevailing macro-economic uncertainties affected consumer spending and impacted growth, particularly in the on-trade. Higher promotional pressures and weaker than expected pricing put pressure on profitability and meant winning proved more challenging, particularly in established markets like Italy, Spain and France. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.602,r=0.292,b=0.734), with ID ad8554af-66b8-4c7f-9ad0-ea95a2a057b8 -->

Our mainstream brands saw stabilised volumes, while our Premium brands like Birra Moretti, Desperados and Heineken® outperformed the category in most markets. Birra Moretti continued to grow in the UK driven by the launch of its line extension, Sale di Mare, a new unfiltered lager with a pinch of Italian sea salt. Next-generation brands including Texels, Ichnusa and El Aguila further boosted our performance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.300,t=0.077,r=0.520,b=0.256), with ID 277f525b-2711-4c05-b4d1-8512f804b465 -->

Elsewhere, we continued to grow our world-class no-
alcohol portfolio. Alongside our ‘always a choice’
message that positions beers for different occasions
for all consumers, Heineken® 0.0 is shaping the future
of the category and stimulating segment growth. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.265,r=0.519,b=0.361), with ID e149c70d-31b5-49c5-86e5-50e4ffb71f82 -->

Growing in beer and beyond  
Growth in 2024 was fuelled by innovation across our portfolio and iconic brand activations to make sure our brands reflect the tastes, values and lifestyles of consumers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.076,r=0.737,b=0.184), with ID 02a6676d-5995-4f68-9e2e-c23541bb66bd -->

In Spain, we grew brand power with Cruzcampo through an impactful campaign, Gitana, which touched the hearts of a younger generation in Andalusia. The brand continued to perform strongly in the UK, ranking as the most successful launch in alcoholic beverages over the past decade. In Italy, our Ichnusa brand stays true to its Sardinian soul. With the campaign ‘se deve finire così, non beveteci nemmeno’, we inspired people to act more thoughtfully: if you drink Ichnusa and leave the bottle behind, we’d rather you hadn’t drunk at all. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.189,r=0.744,b=0.396), with ID be67384d-e143-4963-b47b-ceea33515368 -->

Beyond beer, we announced a small minority stake
investment in the fast-growing Dutch brand STËLZ,
whose seltzer and RTD propositions appeal to Gen Y
and Z consumers. In the UK, we innovated in the
cider category by offering a fresh perspective,
exciting consumers with a diverse range of
adventurous fruit combinations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.403,r=0.744,b=0.534), with ID 8bc74848-91ab-4886-ad3b-d13612ac273d -->

Investing in transformation  
We continue to modernise our business through various initiatives including the bold transformation of our European supply chain. By unifying, digitalising and streamlining operations across our European operating companies, we’re creating a more sustainable, efficient and connected network. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.545,r=0.743,b=0.686), with ID 7019945b-9f2f-439b-a701-e15703e4ef72 -->

Through great collaboration of these country led
initiatives, we are running ahead of our original plan,
delivering significant gross savings across Europe. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.076,r=0.969,b=0.137), with ID 6a2e99c3-435d-44fe-807e-adb73413b5de -->

Elsewhere, we focused on deploying future-fit,
repeatable capabilities to maximise commercial value
and HEINEKEN’s Digital Backbone initiative is on track
to modernise our fragmented technology systems
(read more on this on page 29). Serbia piloted the
programme, showing promising signs of improved
production, sales, customer service and efficiency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.757,t=0.143,r=0.975,b=0.278), with ID 8728d0fa-1138-4be6-b65f-f50de1314304 -->

Sustainability
We continue to work on our sustainability agenda. Following our inauguration of Europe's largest industrial thermal plant in Seville, we opened a second solar thermal facility in Valencia. In France, our regenerative agriculture project yielded its first barley harvest, with 420 farmers adopting practices to improve soil health, biodiversity and carbon reduction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.286,r=0.966,b=0.464), with ID 48ffcb1c-7dbf-4cb8-8d12-e8f0b8a6a14f -->

Water stewardship also advanced in 2024, with a
strong performance on water efficiencies across
the region <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.471,r=0.962,b=0.528), with ID ab0d5755-052d-449b-9f9e-75f1add1349c -->

Our social impact ambition continues. In Spain, the Cruzcampo Foundation drives economic and social development, tackling youth unemployment through hospitality-focused training. Its Hospitality School achieved a 90% job placement rate in 2024, equipping over 350 individuals with skills in kitchen and service, as well as digital marketing customer centric technics. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.536,r=0.970,b=0.684), with ID cc19415a-667a-4364-9db2-4f966ebc1e4d -->

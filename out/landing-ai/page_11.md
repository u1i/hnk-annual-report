Shape the future of beer and beyond

We innovate across beer to respond to market opportunities and to grow the category. This includes a focus on premiumisation that is led by Heineken® but driven across the breadth of our portfolio. We continue to extend our portfolio of low-calorie, flavoured and less bitter variants to meet emerging consumer demand and build our leadership in low and no-alcohol beverages. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.648,t=0.074,r=0.966,b=0.482), with ID c8a4aee9-1adc-4aaf-ac81-cd59bebb6b49 -->

While beer remains fundamental to our business, there are opportunities for growth beyond the category. We continue to invest in cider and other refreshing line extensions to keep our portfolio modern and relevant. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.649,t=0.490,r=0.954,b=0.625), with ID e79765c3-a0c9-4637-9f61-edc39fd2dcce -->

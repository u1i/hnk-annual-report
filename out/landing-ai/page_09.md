# Logistics

Most of our products are produced in the countries where they’re consumed. We manage profitability by enhancing productivity in our warehouses, carefully selecting third-party carriers and optimising our transport network. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.067,t=0.387,r=0.305,b=0.532), with ID de3bd807-f3b2-40bb-83bd-d0565fc59409 -->

This is supported by our digital transformation programme and the ongoing replacement of existing fragmented technologies with a modern, modular architecture and standardised cloud-based platforms. This helps us improve ways of working, transport planning, and warehouse management. Scaling these capabilities across our operations helps us improve customer experience, drive end-to-end efficiencies, reduce emissions and save costs. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.068,t=0.530,r=0.295,b=0.709), with ID 3daf6d2d-a010-4df9-834d-9273dd542058 -->

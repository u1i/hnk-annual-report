Financial review

Main changes in consolidation

On 1 February 2023, HEINEKEN acquired a majority stake in Davidov Hram, a wholesale business in Slovenia.

On 14 April 2023, HEINEKEN obtained control of NBL and on 26 April 2023 of Distell. NBL and Distell have been combined with Heineken South Africa into a new HEINEKEN majority-owned business ‘Heineken Beverages’. Distell and NBL are consolidated within HEINEKEN as from those dates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.071,t=0.025,r=0.519,b=0.186), with ID 1bdb06e1-0715-405a-b0bc-eebabfe41863 -->

On 1 June 2023, HEINEKEN disposed of its licence to brew a brand in the UK.

On 25 August 2023, HEINEKEN announced it completed its exit from Russia.

On 29 September 2023, HEINEKEN completed the sale of soft-drink producer Vrumona in the Netherlands.

Other changes in consolidation in 2024 include the sale of our entire shareholding in Champion Breweries in Nigeria, the disposal of a merchant services company in South Africa and the disposal of our business in Sri Lanka. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.189,r=0.517,b=0.325), with ID a256fad4-aa6d-4d3a-a106-51ed78995781 -->

HEINEKEN applies hyperinflation accounting in Ethiopia and Haiti. Fixed assets are revalued for the inflation from the time of acquisition to date. The prior year impact from depreciation resulting from the revaluation of previous years is recorded as a change in consolidation and is excluded from the organic growth calculation. At the same time, all metrics in the income statement are restated to reflect the inflation level as per the reporting date. These impacts are recorded as exceptional items. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.327,r=0.518,b=0.422), with ID 62a8d8f6-9b72-4c28-a068-0648381a67d4 -->

Revenue

Revenue for the full year was €36.0 billion (2023: €36.4 billion) a total decrease of 1.2%.

Net revenue (beia) increased organically by a solid 5.0% to €30.0 billion, supported in particular by the strong growth of our largest operating companies in Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Vietnam and India. Total consolidated volume increased by 1.4% with net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 3.5%. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 4.1%, with a positive contribution from all regions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.427,r=0.519,b=0.559), with ID 6fe76045-9dd7-4b6e-9776-5aae3805ef75 -->

Net revenue (beia) was dampened by a negative translation impact of €1,656 million, 5.5%, mainly due to the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira, and depreciation of the Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso. The consolidation effect, primarily our exit from Russia and the sale of Vrumona more than offsetting the acquisition benefit of Distell and Namibian Breweries, had a net negative impact of €193 million, or 0.6%. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.562,r=0.513,b=0.648), with ID 36d10ef8-0589-440b-adee-d73fa53ef7c2 -->

Summary : This waterfall bar chart shows the reconciliation of net revenue (beia and IFRS) from FY 2023 to FY 2024, breaking down the contributions of organic growth, currency translation, consolidation impact, and an item labeled "Eia".

waterfall bar chart:
# Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title shown.
  • X-axis: Sequential categories—FY 2023 Net revenue beia, Organic growth, Currency translation, Consolidation impact, FY 2024 Net revenue beia, Eia, FY 2024 Net revenue IFRS.
  • Y-axis: Not labeled, but values are in units (likely millions).
  • Tick labels: 30,308; 1,505; (1,656); (193); 29,964; 143; 29,821.

# Data Points :
  • FY 2023 Net revenue beia: 30,308
  • Organic growth: +1,505
  • Currency translation: –1,656
  • Consolidation impact: –193
  • FY 2024 Net revenue beia: 29,964
  • Eia: +143
  • FY 2024 Net revenue IFRS: 29,821

# Design Encodings :
  • Dark green bars for "Net revenue beia" and "Net revenue IFRS" values.
  • Light green for positive contributions (Organic growth, Eia).
  • Grey for negative contributions (Currency translation, Consolidation impact).
  • Waterfall style: each bar builds on the previous, showing cumulative effects.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • The net revenue starts at 30,308 in FY 2023.
  • Organic growth adds 1,505.
  • Currency translation and consolidation impact subtract 1,656 and 193, respectively.
  • FY 2024 Net revenue beia is 29,964.
  • Eia adds 143.
  • Final FY 2024 Net revenue IFRS is 29,821.

# Analysis :
  • Despite positive organic growth, negative currency translation and consolidation impacts result in a net decrease in revenue from FY 2023 to FY 2024.
  • The "Eia" adjustment is positive but small relative to other factors.
  • The waterfall format clearly isolates the effect of each component on the net revenue transition. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.672,r=0.514,b=0.848), with ID 8f0d7182-cbda-45ee-9ca7-ccf8a0ea610f -->

Expenses
Total net other expenses reduced by 3.1% to €26,304 million (2023: €27,133 million).

Total net other expenses (beia) were €25,452 million, up 4.4% on an organic basis due to increased personnel expenses, increased cost of raw materials in our AME region, particularly Nigeria, and a material step up in investments behind our brands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.528,t=0.075,r=0.965,b=0.193), with ID 8f3022d1-1c5a-4ec4-b63e-5af033b8e180 -->

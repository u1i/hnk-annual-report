Making steady progress on
the path to net zero
Climate change and nature loss are changing how we operate and shaping our plans for the decades to come. We have accelerated efforts to reduce emissions, support a circular economy, and protect the health of local watersheds and nature. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.134,r=0.295,b=0.279), with ID 48a8d53d-cf88-48b6-be8a-677588bb9cbe -->

Our Net Zero strategy focuses on achieving net zero across our value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040¹. We are driving towards net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030² alongside reducing Scope 3 emissions by 26%. We aim to reduce Scope 3 by decreasing forest, land and agriculture (FLAG) emissions by 30% and energy-based emissions (non-FLAG) by 25%. These goals were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2023. All performance on carbon is now measured against a 2022 baseline. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.285,r=0.292,b=0.490), with ID db7f6b88-dbdc-42ca-be4b-36003f591946 -->

Accelerating a reduction in Scope 1 and 2
We have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 34% compared to the 2022 baseline (2023: 19%). We cannot use a one size fits all approach, and decarbonisation requires precise planning and tailored solutions. We are developing custom strategies for each location which account for geographical, socio-political, technological and economic variations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.498,r=0.291,b=0.651), with ID 10f122d9-9216-48db-8b1f-c293046043a1 -->

With hundreds of projects to develop, we must invest
strategically in the most cost-efficient and impactful
initiatives. We have developed a financial model to
evaluate projects and prioritise investments,
strengthening cost management and helping us
define future investments. This enabled us to review
our technology portfolio and deprioritise solutions
where cost trends remain too high. Our approach
combines in-house expertise with strategic external
partnerships. We are collaborating with Siemens, Royal
HaskoningDHV, NIRAS, Engie and Arcadis to drive
decarbonisation efforts across nearly 181 sites globally. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.657,r=0.294,b=0.883), with ID 100615b2-9649-4601-b3a4-e83a12ea9cb1 -->

In 2024, we invested in strategic projects including
an electric boiler in Ethiopia, a heat pump in
Hungary and renewable thermal solutions in
Portugal. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.075,r=0.513,b=0.154), with ID 1cb08dce-75dd-402d-8dd8-611fe675a151 -->

We continue to implement a toolkit to increase the adoption of renewable electricity, including power purchase agreements (PPAs), on-site solutions, energy certificates and other mechanisms. After six years of development, we secured two strategic PPAs in Nigeria and implemented renewable electricity solutions in smaller markets like Suriname, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Peru. In 2024, we used 84% renewable electricity across our global operations. Some of our Renewable Electricity projects allow us to identify cost savings and manage volatile energy prices. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.160,r=0.522,b=0.385), with ID a616290b-4353-4612-bb29-0c0e1f1d9f19 -->

While our holistic approach has enabled us to decouple growth from Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the road ahead is not smooth and we anticipate that future carbon reductions will not be linear. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.390,r=0.518,b=0.469), with ID f96d69ae-2454-419e-bd29-0515baafbaef -->

Access to renewable thermal energy remains a significant challenge. Barriers vary across the globe from fragmented energy infrastructure to gaps in regulation and policy. These obstacles limit available solutions, and make some financially unviable. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.475,r=0.519,b=0.571), with ID c584a87e-f1fc-4ec8-93be-1dbfe8fd9e63 -->

It is too early to determine the impact of such
challenges on our ability to achieve our goals. Despite
this, we remain steadfast in our ambitions and will
continue to engage with policymakers to advocate for
removing barriers to decarbonisation and explore
innovative solutions with our partners. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.302,t=0.578,r=0.518,b=0.691), with ID bc1d92c4-b4b3-406c-bde1-96da420ba50c -->

Establishing the foundations to scale  
Scope 3 reductions  
We aim to reduce Scope 3 emissions by collaborating with strategic suppliers to facilitate the transition to renewable energy, low-carbon technologies, circular packaging and sustainable agricultural practices. Our updated Scope 3 strategy focuses on our largest emissions sources – agriculture and packaging – alongside enhancing supplier capabilities and fostering partnerships. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.301,t=0.697,r=0.519,b=0.887), with ID 618b3180-c9cd-49d6-8d1c-d82df156ef24 -->

1 Net zero is defined by SBTI as reducing a minimum of 90% of emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3. The residual emissions (maximum of 10%) must be neutralised with permanent carbon removal solutions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.076,t=0.908,r=0.484,b=0.939), with ID 2a290c7c-bf83-4577-9591-9803c7fc69a8 -->

² Based on the SBTi definition, we have defined our 2030 goal as a 90% emissions reductions across Scope 1 and 2. A maximum of 10% residual emissions that cannot be eliminated otherwise must be covered with permanent carbon removal and storage solutions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.941,r=0.493,b=0.970), with ID 2bc8ae3c-aaaf-4a54-8cb3-6bf1d818e1b7 -->

Decarbonising Scope 3 is complex, with challenges
including inconsistent emission methodologies and
data quality. While we are making progress, there is
much work still to do. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.076,r=0.741,b=0.154), with ID dfb80c70-0112-46cd-8a12-2bb998d76974 -->

In 2024, we reduced Scope 3 emissions by 14% with a contribution from both agricultural and energy-based emissions (FLAG 23% and non-FLAG 11%) compared to the 2022 baseline. The integration of our recent acquisitions in South Africa and India have reshaped our raw material portfolio, using more apples for cider in South Africa and more rice in India. This new portfolio has a lower carbon intensity and contributes greatly to reducing our FLAG emissions. In contrast, integrating these businesses increased packaging emissions, affecting our non-FLAG results. Our packaging supplier decarbonisation programme has softened the impact of these integrations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.160,r=0.748,b=0.390), with ID 3d264883-8987-4721-81dd-5de60edfcb7f -->

Through the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition
("Supplier LOCT") initiative, we have successfully
equipped suppliers to set Science-Based Targets. To
date, 56 suppliers have established targets, with an
additional 18 suppliers joining the program in 2024.
We launched the REfresh Alliance with 10 beverage
companies to support suppliers in accelerating the
adoption of renewable electricity. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.395,r=0.747,b=0.547), with ID 98105735-d56b-4898-850e-e37a9671d6c5 -->

For agriculture, the third season of our low-carbon farming programme saw almost 300 projects underway, trialling sustainable practices around cover cropping, no-tillage, organic matter use, and seed and fertiliser application. Recognising the potential of low-carbon fertilisers, we provided strategic guidance to FertigHy for its upcoming plant in France. Project Transitions – our first large-scale regenerative agriculture programme with Malteurop Vivescia – will supply its first barley to the French market in 2025. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.529,t=0.553,r=0.748,b=0.759), with ID c357fe1b-70c3-47ff-bf45-2d2bc18c83a7 -->

Currently involving 200 farmers, the project will
measure its impact through key indicators focused
on carbon emissions, soil health and resilience, and
biodiversity. We are working with our suppliers to
comply with SBTi FLAG guidance. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.075,r=0.968,b=0.172), with ID 6bf5b57b-950b-456d-87a7-572634b9553b -->

For packaging, we are launching initiatives to support glass and aluminium suppliers with site-specific roadmaps focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. We are increasing the recycled content in our glass and cans to reduce carbon emissions. In 2024, we conducted six decarbonisation workshops with strategic glass suppliers and mapped over 100 initiatives across Europe, Americas and Africa & Middle East. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.179,r=0.973,b=0.349), with ID e8b66973-d7be-4a94-8682-dfe9737ee745 -->

We also continue to engage in industry initiatives like the Coalition to advance refrigeration standards and promote energy efficiency. In logistics, we partnered with Einride to deploy our first cross-border electric freight journey powered by renewable electricity. Scaling such partnerships across our global operations remains a challenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.756,t=0.354,r=0.971,b=0.487), with ID d7d91137-9b97-47a8-a6c2-456531f81622 -->

Laying the groundwork for carbon removals
Achieving net zero will require access to high-
integrity carbon removals. These solutions take
carbon directly out of the atmosphere and store it in
a durable way, addressing residual emissions we
cannot otherwise eliminate. In 2024, we did not
purchase carbon removals but focused on assessing
opportunities on our own land, with our agricultural
suppliers and third-parties. We will continue to
evaluate emerging standards and implement
consistent practices across the business, securing
carbon removals through a mix of insetting projects
and external carbon credits. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.755,t=0.492,r=0.974,b=0.739), with ID 0b5bc747-bda0-4477-bc86-e93a7578812c -->

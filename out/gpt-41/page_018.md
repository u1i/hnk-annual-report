**Business priority**  
**Raise the bar on sustainability and responsibility**

We recognise that our activities have both negative and positive impacts on the environment and society. Since 2021, our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy has been the foundation for driving progress towards a net zero, fairer and more balanced world.

As we achieved some of our 2023 goals, we refined our approach. We remain focused on our three pillars – Environmental, Social and Responsible, and continue working within our business and across our value chain to drive transformational and long-term change.

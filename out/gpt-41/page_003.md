### Right Column – Q&A Content

#### What are your top reflections on 2024?
We delivered strong top and bottom-line performance while investing in the future. I’m proud of our 85,000 employees: volatility remains, but we’re navigating it with agility and resilience.

Beer volume grew organically in all regions, with net revenue (beia) increasing organically by 5%. We gained or held market share in more than half our markets, driven by growth in Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Vietnam. Led by Heineken® and complemented by international and local premium brands like Birra Moretti, Desperados and Kingfisher Ultra, premium beer volume grew organically in the mid-single digits.

We continued to pioneer choice in low and no-alcohol (LONO) beverages, with portfolio volume growth in high single-digits and Heineken® 0.0 further consolidating its position as the world’s #1 non-alcoholic beer brand.

With operating profit (beia) growth of 8.3%, we’re delivering strong financials while also investing in the future through big investments in marketing and digitalisation.

#### How is HEINEKEN delivering on its EverGreen strategy?
Our EverGreen strategy aims to drive superior balanced growth while future-proofing the business.

We’re driving premiumisation at scale, led by Heineken®. Alongside our sponsorship platforms, innovations in campaigns like “Heineken® The 1st Ahhh!” and “The boring phone” delivered premium organic beer volume growth of 5%.

To fund our growth, we delivered €0.6 billion in gross savings in 2024, surpassing our €0.5 billion target. Productivity gains from supplier collaborations, procurement, digitalisation and transport optimisation allowed reinvestment in innovation, brand strength, digital transformation and sustainability.

We made progress against our Brew a Better World 2030 ambitions, reducing Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 34% and Scope 3 by 14%. In total 39% of our volumes were sold in reusable format and we have 44% recycled content in bottles and cans.

Our digital transformation continued in 2024 with investment in our eBusiness platforms and our Digital Backbone (DBB). Leveraging data across almost all our operating companies, we deployed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver insights that enhance productivity, customer satisfaction and agility.

People drive our success. To strengthen our winning culture, we launched LEAD, our global people manager initiative, and HEINEKEN’s Women’s Summit, a development programme for senior female leaders. These are accelerating our existing talent and leadership development initiatives.

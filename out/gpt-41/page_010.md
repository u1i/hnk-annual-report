**Our strategy**

### Introductory Text
**EverGreen is a bold multi-year strategy that empowers us to adapt to a fast-changing world and future-proof the business.**

We brew more than just beer; we brew the joy of true togetherness to inspire a better world. With every pour, we create space for connection. With every moment shared, we create space for joy.

This is our purpose—our reason for being. It shapes both our values and our dream to win the hearts of consumers by shaping the future of beer and beyond, guiding our actions in the short and long term. We’re committed to empowering a more open-minded, meaningfully connected world, and building a company that can constantly renew, adapt and improve itself in service of this aim.

Inspired by this purpose, EverGreen is our strategy to deliver superior and balanced growth, which puts us on a journey of constant renewal and adaption.

This strategy focuses on five business priorities: enhancing our diverse portfolio of brands to cater for evolving tastes and needs; driving productivity that frees resources for investment in balanced growth; leveraging digital transformation to streamline our operations and deepen consumer connections; weaving our Brew A Better World ambitions into decision making; and helping our people thrive within a winning culture.

That’s EverGreen, and through it we are positioned to meet short-term challenges, ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and create lasting value for all our stakeholders.

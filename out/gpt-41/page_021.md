## Detailed Transcript

### Main Heading
**Raise the bar on sustainability and responsibility**

#### Reducing water use in production
Our goal for 2030 is to reduce average water intake in our breweries to 2.6 hl/hl in water-stressed sites and 2.9 hl/hl globally. In 2024, our average water usage was 3.0 hl/hl (2023: 3.0 hl/hl) in water-stressed areas and 3.1 hl/hl (2023: 3.2) across all our breweries achieving an 11% reduction (12% adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures) versus the 2018 baseline.

We expanded our water efficiency acceleration programme in collaboration with cleaning and disinfection suppliers. The programme is active at 56 sites spanning all regions and is delivering results, such as in Italy and Brazil, where water use per hectolitre of beer is down by 13% and 9%, respectively. We shared best practices from the programme on our global platform, enabling production sites to learn, share and reapply them within the Company. Advanced technologies and water treatment optimisation are also delivering results across many sites, including in Mexico and Ethiopia. In Myanmar, a shift in water treatment saved around 1.0 hl/hl, and in Cambodia adjusting the source of water withdrawal delivered a 0.4 hl/hl reduction in water use.

#### Water balancing in water-stressed areas
Our goal is to fully balance the water we put in our products in water-stressed areas by 2030.

Following water risk assessments in India and France, we increased the number of water-stressed sites from 32 in 2023 to 41 in 2024. Of these 41 sites, 36 have started water balancing projects and 29% are fully water balanced. As the number of sites in scope increases, it is harder to achieve our goals and we are challenged to think creatively and to partner with diverse stakeholders to identify projects and drive collective action.

Many projects support biodiversity and involve conservation and reforestation initiatives. All three sites in Indonesia achieved 100% water balancing by restoring 490 hectares within the Brantas and Cisadane watersheds. In Nigeria, our collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) expanded to cover the reforestation of 292 hectares (48 hectares in 2024), contributing to increased water infiltration and reducing soil erosion. We also launched the Heiferst Project in Brazil, a large-scale reforestation effort with Rizoma which aims to restore pastureland and introduce agroforestry practices in citrus cultivation through regenerative agriculture. Reforestation efforts also continue in Ethiopia, Malaysia and Mexico.

#### Improving water access with communities
Our water access projects aim to support local communities in priority regions to have reliable access to clean and safe water, aligning with our water and social ambitions.

In Burundi, we partnered with Amazi Water to enhance access to clean water for communities near our brewery. The initiative will install water tanks, solar panels and a solar-powered pump with the capacity to serve up to 1,000 households.

In Tunisia we installed over 400 water counters to help families in Leqilme access clean water. Multiple projects are underway in India including the improvement of water storage in Karnataka. We also continue to support projects that improve community access to water near our production sites in Vietnam, Nigeria and Brazil.

#### Maintaining the focus on sustainability and agriculture
Our sustainable sourcing programme contributes to many of our environmental goals, as well as delivering social and business benefits.

We aim to increase the proportion of our key ingredients – barley and hops – that are sustainably sourced to 100% by 2030, based on the globally recognised Farm Sustainability Assessment by the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform. In 2024, 94% of our hops and 74% of our barley qualify as sustainably sourced in accordance with the SAI bronze standard or higher.

In Mexico, we started our journey to sustainably sourced barley in 2018. This year, 40 suppliers applying sustainable farm practices delivered 62% of the volume. The local production plan involves training, on-site consulting and internal audits, with 275 more suppliers to start certification to progress the journey. Mexico also partners with Malteroup, aiming to reduce the volume of water used to irrigate barley while respecting yield and quality. After three years, water savings of around 25% and a stable, high yield of 8.5 tonnes per hectare were recorded.

#### Developing our position on nature
Protecting and restoring biodiversity is linked to many of our environmental initiatives. We have carried out a nature assessment of our breweries and supply chain to better understand the extent of nature-related impacts and dependencies across our value chain. We will develop our approach by focusing on biodiversity-sensitive locations where we operate and by working with stakeholders in our agricultural supply chain.

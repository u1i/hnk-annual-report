#### Section: Upstream

##### Agriculture
HEINEKEN sources key ingredients like barley, hops, corn and bittersweet apples (for cider) from farmers, working closely with suppliers to improve crop yields and quality.

As one of the world’s top three users of malted barley, our sourcing strategy is designed to bring flexibility to the supply chain. We obtain barley from across the world, including Western and Central Europe, the UK, Scandinavia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Australia, the US, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.

In Africa, where barley is scarce, we primarily import malt and rely on local ingredients like cassava, sorghum and rice, sourced from over 150,000 smallholder farmers.

#### Section: Packaging

Most of our beer and cider is served in bottles, cans and kegs, with glass and aluminium as primary packaging materials and plastic and paper for secondary packaging. Packaging plays a vital role in protecting our products through preserving freshness and in enhancing our marketing and branding with distinctive designs that convey their premium nature.

In most cases our packaging is sourced from suppliers, who compete in a competitive market on price, capacity, volume and quality. Driving efficiencies along our end-to-end supply chain is a key success factor: we are unifying, digitalising and streamlining operations across all our breweries.

#### Section: Operations

##### Brewing
We operate 181 breweries, cider plants and other production facilities worldwide. Currently, 90 breweries are connected to our Connected Brewery programme, enabling them to utilise Smart Brewery technology. This integration helps reduce waste and maximise output. Additionally, our connected worker apps empower over 20,000 operators with smart instructions and support, further enhancing efficiency.

Elsewhere, Total Productivity Maintenance streamlines performance reporting and enhances equipment reliability, and robotics are increasingly used to automate and improve safety, maintenance and other critical tasks. By connecting thousands of machines generating billions of data points, we optimise productivity and quality while delivering recurring cost savings.

As these pages show the full breadth of our influence along the chain, we’ve highlighted our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 are direct emissions that are owned or controlled by us. Scope 2 and 3 are indirect emissions as a consequence of our activities and occur from sources we don’t control, but do influence. We have sustainability initiatives along our value chain and see this as another crucial source of wider value creation.

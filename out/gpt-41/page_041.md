#### Leadership, talent and capabilities

**What could happen?**
Our EverGreen ambition requires us to unlock the full potential of our people and organisation. If HEINEKEN is not successful in intentionally attracting, developing, retaining and promoting diverse talent to build a strong succession for leadership and other critical management roles, it could have an impact on business continuity and results.

**Recent developments**
We are on a journey of continued investment in leadership development while further strengthening our internal talent review processes and local talent acquisition functions and empowering our people to build skills for today & the future. This will ensure we have a strong talent pipeline to deliver the right talent in the right roles at the right time supported by leaders who can drive sustainable business growth.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
Talent Management remains one of the strategic capabilities to deliver our EverGreen Strategy. Our potential model enables our common language for understanding strengths and growth opportunities for our talents. In 2024, we refreshed our Talent Review process powered by this model improving both our ability to identify talent, and also our ability to help them realise their potential through their personal development plans. This has translated into proactive identification, validation & acceleration of global talent pools through intentional development opportunities.

We launched our Global Graduate Program in 2024 to further strengthen our pipeline of high-calibre, homegrown, diverse talent for senior roles and continued utilising our Senior Leader Assessment & Development Centre. Our Talent Acquisition & Talent Management Global Communities of Practice have been further embedded to build and strengthen talent capability across our organisation.

In 2024 we rolled out LEAD – a new global People Manager program – designed to support our ~15,000 people managers to become even more effective at developing their people and building strong talent pipelines for the future.

In addition, our inclusion and diversity network continues to build an inclusive and equitable environment in HEINEKEN where everyone feels valued. We also achieved external recognition by the World Economic Forum who selected HEINEKEN’s Women in Sales initiative as a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Lighthouse.

#### Health and safety

**What could happen?**
HEINEKEN aims to provide a healthy and safe workplace for all employees, temporary workers and contractors. Despite the controls in place, if HEINEKEN employees, temporary workers, contractors and visitors may be impacted by uncontrolled events in the brewery, such as fire, toxic material or run or traffic accidents, which could be illness, serious injuries or fatalities potentially followed by business disruption, losses, reputational or legal claims.

**Recent developments**
Despite our continuous efforts to provide safe working conditions, in 2024 we still experienced incidents with significant safety impact on our premises, including resulting in two fatal accidents, involving one employee and one contractor, underlining the importance of realizing further improvements in the area of safety, health and well-being.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
Our Safety, Health and Well-being strategy reflects our company’s safety culture. We focus on shaping a proactive Health & Safety culture with safety being in our ways of working, counting on everyone’s leadership, engagement and participation. Throughout the Company, the HEINEKEN Life Saving Rules set the minimum standards that carry the greatest safety risks for employees, temporary workers and contractors. In 2024 we have also reviewed existing policies, both in the plant and the off to remove potential risks to safety, such as the switch from motorbikes to cars and introduction of pedestrian crossing areas and/or braided drinks in breweries.

As the validity of quality (emergency) healthcare services across the large number of countries and regions in which we operate, ensuring access to quality medical care to our national and international employees and their family members remains a priority.

To ensure healthcare coverage, HEINEKEN counts on a number of health professionals in countries and regions where healthcare services are not adequate. Those employees and dependents who have access to broad medical services including advanced lab tests, medicines and pharmacy, health benefits, disease prevention and health promotion, protection, emergency evacuations, health monitoring.

In the field area, mental health has been identified as an area of continued focus. To address this risk, we keep investing in our internal well-being programs to ensure the wellbeing of our employees and contractors.

#### Product safety and integrity

**What could happen?**
Poor quality or contamination of HEINEKEN products, be it accidental or malicious, could lead to health risks, reputational damage, financial liabilities, supply chain disruption and product recalls.

**Recent developments**
The environment we operate in is constantly evolving. Changes in our product portfolio, increasing awareness of (new) potential food hazards, rising consumer concerns over food safety, social media and a more complex legal framework require ongoing efforts to adapt and respond. Ensuring food safety for our consumers remains a top priority.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
HEINEKEN has established a comprehensive Company-wide Quality Assurance program that addresses employee competencies, production standards, recipe management, supplier governance and robust material risk management. Continuous improvement is driven through global compliance monitoring and systematic change programs.

All our production units, including outsourced production of HEINEKEN brands, are required to implement an externally certified Food Safety Management System in compliance with GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative) standards. In 2024, 97% of our breweries have a certified Food Safety System with the rest also applying the HACCP methodology. The same requirement is in place for implementation of a Quality Management System certified under ISO9001 and as of the end of 2024 over 90% of our breweries have an ISO9001 certification, or are expected to be certified next year. All raw, auxiliary and packaging materials must be sourced from approved suppliers and meet our Product Material Specifications. Every product must follow a Basic Recipe, adhering to our Recipe Governance standards.

In the event of a risk, global recall and crisis procedures are in place to mitigate the impact. Every production unit, including outsourced production of HEINEKEN brands, has the capability to block and/or recall products and communicate to the HEINEKEN Technical standard. Compliance to our standards is ensured through self-assessments and globally managed compliance audits, while internal integrity surveys check the products for known contaminants to verify the effectiveness of these standards.

Additionally, HEINEKEN stays ahead of emerging legislation and risks by working closely with partners, suppliers and external stakeholders to implement proactive measures that prevent such risks.

#### Supply chain continuity

**What could happen?**
Supply chain disruptions such as closures for the Red Sea shipping routes can have far-reaching consequences, including the potential to increase costs, reduce product delivery, financial setbacks, harm to brand reputation, and a decline in market presence. Sudden market fluctuations in the availability or pricing of essential inputs such as raw materials, commodities, transportation, energy and water may precipitate shortages in supply or elevated operational expenses.

**Recent developments**
The global supply chain landscape continues to deal with disruptions and risk of further escalation, e.g. Suez Canal closure. Throughout the year, we have observed several instances where our suppliers have been adversely affected by these events, resulting in price volatility and constrained challenges. The availability of certain critical resources has become constrained, driven by factors like climate change, and the prevailing global political instability.

Furthermore, the growing concern of climate change and ongoing market shortages are starting to have effects on how much crops can grow, as well as the availability and prices of grains. Considering these developments, it is proactive for both markets and governments to take actions that address these changing dynamics. It is necessary to adapt and design effective flexibility.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
HEINEKEN has effectively minimised the impact of disruptions by leveraging the widespread presence and strong supplier relationships across various regions and product categories. Our agile sourcing approach (including our geographic split of global, regional and local sourcing), combined with the adaptability of our breweries worldwide, has ensured the continued flow of supplies across our global operations.

We’ve taken proactive measures to safeguard business continuity by deploying comprehensive plans for HEINEKEN’s flagship brands in all critical markets, along with implementing contingency solutions within our breweries, including prioritising raw materials for delivery or ownership of strategic production facilities, long-term procurement contracts, multi-sourcing, inventory management policies, and centralised oversight of global insurance and risk.

HEINEKEN has adopted a needs-centric strategic mindset at preserving water resources. Sustainable sourcing is a top priority with our Brew a Better World 2030 initiative, reflecting our dedication to making a positive impact on the environment and society.

**Unlock the full potential of our people**

Our people are at the heart of our success and are our top priority. With this in mind, our strategy is grounded in four areas: future-proofing our talent and organisation; driving excellence to enhance processes and competitiveness; unifying our people approach globally; and protecting and respecting every individual.

These areas guide our efforts to build a winning culture where everyone thrives. We are nurturing exceptional leaders, developing inspired and purpose-driven teams, and fostering an inclusive, equitable environment.

Crucially, we are committed to our people’s health, safety and wellbeing, and we will continue working on our social sustainability and human rights agenda.

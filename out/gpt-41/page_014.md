## Detailed Transcript

### Main Heading
**Shape the future of beer and beyond**

#### Subheading: Desperados – the beer with Latin vibe
Desperados is a unique product that offers the spirit of experimentation, spontaneity and self-expression, engaging with young consumers across more than 30 markets globally. In 2024, the brand embarked on a review of its DNA to ensure even greater relevance with Gen Z audiences and enhance consistency across its markets.

This reflection culminated in a bold new positioning, The Beer with a Latin Vibe, set to launch in January 2025. Inspired by the belief that life is connected as a life un lived, the positioning will come to fruition through a complete brand reset (campaign, visual identity, below the line, experiential and innovation) igniting moments of connection and celebration. This reset will tap into a series of culturally relevant passion points, empowering Gen Z to sidestep life’s uncertainties and live it to the full.

The new positioning will deepen connections with Gen Z and pave the way for new consumer recruitment across the HEINEKEN portfolio.

#### Subheading: Sol – sun-powered positivity
Sol spreads positivity and brightens the world with optimism, encouraging carefree enjoyment since 1899.

Present in over 50 markets, Sol continued to shine in 2024, achieving single-digit growth outside its home market of Mexico and strong performance in Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Colombia.

Innovation played a key role, with the launch of Sol 0.0% in Brazil – a no-alcohol beer enriched with vitamins for health-conscious consumers – and Sol Mix, a range of cocktail-inspired flavoured lagers, in Chile. In Mexico, Sol Mezcals now leads the flavoured beer category.

Alongside these innovations, the brand is refreshing its visual identity with a bold, legacy-inspired design, starting in South Africa and set for a global roll-out in 2025.

With a new campaign launching in 2025, Sol is poised to strengthen its connection with consumers by offering vibrant, versatile experiences that meet the evolving demands of modern beer drinkers.

#### Subheading: Pioneering choice in low and no-alcohol
The drivers of moderation are evolving. As wellbeing becomes more holistic, positive and lifestyle-oriented, consumers want choices that align with diverse needs and occasions.

The 0.0 beer category is one of the fastest-growing, expanding at 5% annually over the past five years. HEINEKEN leads the way, shaping and driving the category’s growth. Now available in 117 countries, Heineken® 0.0 is the global leader in the low and no alcohol space.

We continued to drive growth for Heineken® 0.0 across 2024, building engagement with consumers through communications, sponsorships and heavyweight media investment. Evidence of our commitment and belief in the category is the ongoing wide-scale roll-out of 0.0 on draught in Spain, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland. A significant driver in the democratisation of non-alcoholic beer, this is breaking down lingering stigma and boosting accessibility.

Elsewhere, innovation continued to fuel our portfolio. In Poland, Żywiec 0.0, HEINEKEN’s third-largest 0.0 brand, grew by 36% in 2024, driven by its botanical flavoured zero range, which nearly doubled volumes with raspberry and mint line extensions.

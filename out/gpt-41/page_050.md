## Detailed Transcript

### Main Heading
**Corporate Governance statement**

#### Subheading
**Composition of the Executive Board**

**Executive Board members are appointed by the AGM from a non-binding nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board.**

The Supervisory Board appoints one of the Executive Board members as Chair/CEO. The AGM can dismiss members of the Executive Board by a majority of votes cast if the subject majority at least represents one-third of the issued capital.

The Executive Board consists of two members, Chair/CEO Dolf (R.G.S.) van den Brink and CFO Harold (H.P.J.) van den Broek.

Best practice provision 2.2.1 of the Code recommends that an Executive Board member is appointed for a maximum period of four years and that a member may be re-appointed for a term of not more than four years at a time. In compliance with this best practice provision, the Supervisory Board has drawn up a rotation schedule to avoid, as much as possible, a situation in which Executive Board members retire at the same time.

Mr. Van den Brink and Mr. Van den Broek are, respectively, in their second and first four-year term as members of the Executive Board, being reappointed in 2024 and appointed in 2021. A proposal for the re-appointment of Mr. Van den Broek for a second four-year term as member of the Executive Board was decided by the Supervisory Board on 1 October 2024 and will be submitted to the AGM in 2025 for approval.

#### Subheading
**Other Appointments**

Internal regulations prescribe that members of the Executive Board of the Company will not accept more than two supervisory board memberships or non-executive directorships in a Large Dutch Entity.

Prior to accepting an external board membership of a Large Dutch Entity or a foreign equivalent, the proposal will be discussed with the other member of the Executive Board. The proposal will subsequently be submitted to the Chair of the Supervisory Board. The Chair will obtain approval from the Selection and Appointment Committee of the Supervisory Board and will inform the other members of the Supervisory Board, in line with the regulations of the Selection and Appointment Committee.

Furthermore, prior to accepting any other external functions, such proposal will also be discussed with the other member of the Executive Board. If there are no objections, the proposal will be submitted to the Chair of the Supervisory Board for approval. With approval of the Chair the function can be accepted. The Chair of the Supervisory Board will inform the other members of the Supervisory Board.

The Chair/CEO has no external board membership of a Large Dutch Entity or foreign equivalent and neither has a few external positions. The CFO has no external board membership of a Large Dutch entity or a foreign equivalent or other external positions.

The Supervisory Board ascertains that the members of the Executive Board (i) comply with the Dutch Act on Management and Supervision as regards the maximum number of supervisory board seats and non-executive board memberships in Large Dutch Entities and (ii) have sufficient time to devote to their duties and responsibilities, as provided by Principle 2.4 of the Code.

The Supervisory Board has concluded that each member of the Executive Board has sufficient time to discharge its duties as director of the Company, taking into account the Chair/CEO’s limited number of other external positions, and also recognizing that these positions are not materially time consuming.

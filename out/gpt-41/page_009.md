### Logistics
Most of our products are produced in the countries where they’re consumed. We manage profitability by enhancing productivity in our warehouses, carefully selecting third-party carriers and optimising our transport network.

This is supported by our digital transformation programme and the ongoing replacement of existing fragmented technologies with a modern, modular architecture and standardised cloud-based platforms. This helps us improve ways of working, transport planning, and warehouse management. Scaling these capabilities across our operations helps us improve customer experience, drive end-to-end efficiencies, reduce emissions and save costs.

### Customers
Our customers include retailers, wholesalers and distributors, bars, restaurants and clubs where consumers enjoy moments of connection and celebration. In some countries, such as the UK, Mexico and Egypt, we also own and operate bars and retail outlets.

Our scale combined with new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions helps us continuously improve customer experiences and grow revenues. Digital innovation is providing insight that transforms sales representatives into strategic business advisors and delivers personalised recommendations to customers, boosting sales on our eB2B platform. Elsewhere, increasingly connected outlets are helping customers automate stock replenishment and optimise inventory.

### Consumers
Every day, millions of consumers across 190 countries enjoy one of our more than 500 brands. Our premium portfolio approach offers consumers choice while strengthening pricing power and driving revenues.

Innovation, particularly in low and no-alcohol categories, caters for evolving tastes. HEINEKEN’s global scale allows us to sponsor major events like Formula 1 and the UEFA Champions League, enhancing brand visibility. We use digital tools and apps to enrich the experiences of existing consumers and win new ones, simultaneously delivering valuable data that informs ongoing marketing optimisation and boosts revenue.

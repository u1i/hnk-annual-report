## Detailed Transcript

### Main Heading
**Become the best-connected brewer**

### Section 1: Digitalising our route to consumer
HEINEKEN has cherished its relationships with customers and consumers for more than 150 years. In a world where customers expect instant, personalised service online and consumers demand Netflix-style experiences across their interactions with all brands, we’re building new digital capabilities to keep these connections strong.

This involves developing innovative online platforms for customers and embracing new digital consumer engagement models. Crucially, this digitisation journey is giving us access to better, richer data that we’re using to further improve our service, optimise engagement and empower growth. While this journey is far from over, 2024 was a pivotal year.

### Section 2: Revolutionising customer engagement
In 2024, we continued to put our customers at the centre of everything we do, reimagining how they interact with us across every touchpoint: through eB2B platforms, sales representatives, customer service agents and distributors.

‘eezle’, the brand name and identity for our eB2B platforms, aims to make our customers’ business easy. As part of our journey to create an integrated, end-to-end platform across all key touchpoints and reimagine the customer experience, eezle has so far been launched in four markets. The approach is already bearing fruit: over the course of 2024, the platform achieved close to €13 billion in gross merchandise value, connecting with 670,867 active customers and accounting for 70% of fragmented trade revenue – up from 60% in 2023.

Crucially, our success in driving up the number of customers engaging with us through digital channels is supporting the acceleration of wider data-driven innovation to deliver better service for customers and growth for HEINEKEN.

Beyond engagement, we continued to pioneer smart solutions to drive efficiencies for both customers and our business. Experiments with connected outlets allowed us to automate stock replenishment in bars, while continued investment in shelf image recognition technology is helping retailers optimise their inventory.

Our digitisation of customer experience is dramatically improving our customer relationships. Our customer NPS scores have increased steadily over the years to 68 in 2024.

### Section 3: Deepening consumer connections
Alongside our customer initiatives, we’re harnessing digital innovation to help create richer, more meaningful and personalised experiences for consumers – and deliver growth.

In 2024, we supported our brand teams in launching consumer-facing applications that resonate with our diverse global audiences. The Player 0.0 app, for example, embedded HEINEKEN in the gaming community by leveraging our ambassador Max Verstappen through our Formula 1 campaign. Elsewhere, Heit helped consumers in cities organise social events effortlessly and discover new experiences and venues. Initiatives such as these not only delivered brand growth, but also generated valuable first-party consumer data that we use to optimise media spend and marketing activations.

As we digitise, our stakeholders’ privacy is our priority. We have continued to invest in providing the necessary privacy protection around our consumers and their data in all our markets.

#### Section: Explanatory Text

*Shareholders’ equity decreased by €475 million to 19,581 million, mainly driven by the net profit of €978 million offset by the negative other comprehensive income of €472 million, and dividend payments to shareholders of €969 million.*

*Total borrowings amounted to €17,049 million (2023: €18,238 million). Net debt decreased to €14,651 million (2023: €15,835 million) as the strong free operating cash flow exceeded dividend payments and negative foreign currency effects on net debt. Including the effect of cross-currency swaps, 77% of net debt is Euro-denominated, and 12% is US dollar and US dollar proxy currencies.*

*The pro-forma 12-month rolling net debt/EBITDA (beia) ratio was 2.2x on 31 December 2024 (2023: 2.4x), in line with the Company’s long-term target net debt/EBITDA (beia) ratio of below 2.5x.*

*The centrally available financing headroom at Group level was approximately €3.8 billion at 31 December 2024 (2023: €3.2 billion) and consisted of the undrawn part of the committed €3.5 billion revolving credit facility and centrally available cash minus centrally issued commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings at group level.*

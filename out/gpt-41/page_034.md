## Detailed Transcript

### Main Heading
**Africa and Middle East**

### Subheading
**Challenges and growth**

#### Introductory Paragraph
2024 was a year of resilience and growth for the Africa Middle East (AME) region. To manage significant economic volatility, social instability and inflationary pressures, HEINEKEN focused on courageous pricing, disciplined cost management, prudent investments and innovative brand building to deliver balanced performance and position our business for long-term growth.

#### Section: Navigating a tough environment
We remain committed to our long-term vision for AME, however, we faced significant headwinds in 2024 including major currency devaluations in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt, and widespread inflation that pressured consumer purchasing power. Social unrest further complicated operations in countries like Ethiopia, the DRC, Kenya and Mozambique. HEINEKEN mitigated these challenges with courageous pricing, strict cost management and a prudent approach to investment, enabling the region to achieve both organic profit growth and volume growth.

#### Paragraphs on Business Actions and Expansion
Nigerian Breweries activated its Business Recovery Plan, including a successful rights issue, company-wide reorganisation and the temporary suspension of two of its nine breweries.

It also completed the acquisition of Distell Nigeria, providing access to a complementary portfolio of fast-growing wine and spirit brands. These steps helped achieve volume growth and laid the foundations for a return to profitability.

We further optimised our footprint with the sale of Champion Breweries in Nigeria and the announcement of the construction of a state-of-the-art brewery in Dubai through Shorooq, our long-standing joint venture with Maritime and Mercantile International. This first large-scale facility in the Gulf region will support Dubai’s burgeoning tourism industry.

In South Africa, we made important steps to complete the integration of the acquired Distell business, with encouraging results across the portfolio. Strong growth in cider was led by Savanna including the launch of a premium, whisky-flavoured cider, Savanna Neat. The launch of a new spritzer, Bernini Mimosa, reinforced the brand’s strong position with women. It was a positive year of growth for Namibia Breweries, which also benefited from the integration of the Distell portfolio.

Elsewhere, we took significant steps forward to become the best-connected brewer with the successful roll-out of pilots of our new Digital Backbone (more on this on page 29) in two AME operating companies that simplify our IT landscape and drive productivity.

#### Section: Premiumisation and innovation
We drove premiumisation at scale led by the Heineken® brand, which enjoyed consistent volume growth across the region. Our affordable premium brands expanded into new markets with launches like Amstel in Algeria and Tiger in the DRC. Desperados continued its upward trajectory, particularly in Nigeria.

Local icons also played a pivotal role in strengthening HEINEKEN’s presence. Life and Goldberg delivered impressive growth in Nigeria, while Maltiina’s ‘Share Kindness-Share Happiness’ campaign revitalised consumer engagement. A refreshed identity for Turbo King resonated strongly, achieving solid growth in key markets.

#### Section: Sustainability
Half of the beer we sell in AME is in returnable glass bottles. In 2024 we made a further step in our carbon reduction journey with the launch of the Heineken® ‘Star’ returnable bottle in South Africa and introduced public spaces called ‘Green Zones’ across the country. In Nigeria, we celebrated an important milestone with the signing of a PPA to supply two off-grid breweries with 100% renewable electricity. Our agricultural footprint in Africa continues to grow, with over 60% of raw materials locally sourced, including five OpCos that sourced more than 75% locally for the first time. We continued to invest in our people with 75% of senior managers being from the region and 30% being women.

#### Section: HEINEKEN Africa Foundation
The HEINEKEN Africa Foundation continued its mission to empower small-scale farmers through regenerative agriculture. Pilot projects in Burundi and Ethiopia progressed significantly in 2024 and there are plans underway for a new initiative in Mozambique in 2025. By 2027, the Foundation plans to impact over 47,000 farming families across these countries, fostering climate resilience and sustainable livelihoods.

## Detailed Transcript

### Main Heading
**Shape the future of beer and beyond**

### Section: Stretching beyond beer
In 2024, we continued to make strategic investments and expand our portfolio of refreshing brands beyond beer, particularly in markets where beer faces challenges or where significant growth potential exists. This strategy reflects shifting consumer preferences and evolving drinking behaviours, largely driven by Gen Z.

Red Stripe, for example, tapped into their heritage to stretch beyond beer with the expansion of Rum Stripe beyond the US and Jamaica to the UK. Building on its successful launch in Vietnam and Singapore in 2023, Tiger Soju expanded into yet more markets in 2024.

Following our investment in 2023, UK-based ready-to-drink (RTD) brand SERVED introduced premium cocktails and broadened its on and off-trade distribution. We also acquired a small minority stake in Netherlands-based STËLZ, whose low-calorie hard seltzers and spirit mixers resonate with Gen Z consumers. Additionally, a small investment in G Spot, a startup founded by actress Gillian Anderson offering alternatives to traditional wellness brands, is helping us learn about the evolution of functional beverages in the UK.

With an eye on the future, we launched a Beyond Beer incubation hub in the UK to nurture and grow our Beyond Beer portfolio through separate sales and marketing channels. This unit has already introduced Desperados Cocktails and Rum Stripe in select London channels.

### Section: Cider returns to growth
After years of decline, the cider category is back on track, closing 2024 at 8mhl – up organically 2% year-on-year. Momentum was strong in South Africa, Mozambique, Ireland, Spain and the Czech Republic.

In the UK, our cider portfolio continued to grow, powered by the success of Inch’s and Old Mout. In South Africa, our cider portfolio outperformed the category thanks to the exceptional performance of Savanna. Innovations including the launch of a premium, whisky-flavoured cider, Savanna Neat, further solidified our leadership position. We successfully pushed the boundaries of the cider category in Spain, with Ladrón de Verano contributing significantly to growth.

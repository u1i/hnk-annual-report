**Business priority**  
**Become the best-connected brewer**

We’re continuing to increase our investment in digital transformation to build a future-proof company. To become the best-connected brewer, HEINEKEN needs to digitalise its route-to-consumer, unlock the value of data, simplify and automate end-to-end processes, build a secure and modern technology landscape, and create a digitally enabled organisation.

This year we’ve successfully gone live with our Digital Backbone – our biggest ever digital transformation – which enables us to standardise and modernise our business and ways of working.

Supported with robust capabilities that enhance AI literacy, this will pave the way for a shift from everyday AI to game-changing AI.”

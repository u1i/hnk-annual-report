**Shape the future of beer and beyond**

**Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024**

**Desperados – the beer with Latin vibe**
Desperados is a unique product that offers the spirit of experimentation, spontaneity and self-expression, engaging with young consumers across more than 30 markets globally. In 2024, the brand embarked on a review of its DNA to ensure even greater relevance with Gen Z audiences and enhance consistency across its markets.

This reflection culminated in a bold new positioning, The Beer with a Latin Vibe, set to launch in January 2025. Inspired by the belief that a life constrained is a life unlived, the positioning will come to fruition through a complete brand reset (campaign, visual identity, below the line, experiential and innovation) igniting moments of connection and celebration. This reset will tap into a series of culturally relevant passion points, empowering Gen Z to sidestep life's uncertainties and live it to the full.

The new positioning will deepen connections with Gen Z and pave the way for new consumer recruitment across the HEINEKEN portfolio.

**Sol – sun-powered positivity**
Sol spreads positivity and brightens the world with optimism, encouraging carefree enjoyment since 1899.

Present in over 50 markets, Sol continued to shine in 2024, achieving single-digit growth outside its home market of Mexico and strong performance in Brazil, South Africa, Chile and Colombia.

Innovation played a key role, with the launch of Sol 0.0% in Brazil – a no-alcohol beer enriched with vitamins for health-conscious consumers – and Sol Mix, a range of cocktail-inspired flavoured lagers, in Chile. In Mexico, Sol Mezclas now leads the flavoured beer category.

Alongside these innovations, the brand is refreshing its visual identity with a bold, legacy-inspired design, starting in South Africa and set for a global roll-out in 2025.

With a new campaign launching in 2025, Sol is poised to strengthen its connection with consumers by offering vibrant, versatile experiences that meet the evolving demands of modern beer drinkers.

**Pioneering choice in low and no-alcohol**
The drivers of moderation are evolving. As wellbeing becomes more holistic, positive and lifestyle-oriented, consumers want choices that align with diverse needs and occasions.

The 0.0 beer category is one of the fastest-growing, expanding at 5% annually over the past five years. HEINEKEN leads the way, shaping and driving the category's growth. Now available in 117 countries, Heineken® 0.0 is the global leader in the low and no-alcohol space.

We continued to drive growth for Heineken® 0.0 across 2024, building engagement with consumers through communications, sponsorships and heavyweight media investment. Evidence of our commitment and belief in the category is the ongoing wide-scale roll-out of 0.0 on draught in Spain, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland. A significant driver in the democratisation of non-alcoholic beer, this is breaking down lingering stigma and boosting accessibility.

Elsewhere, innovation continued to fuel our portfolio. In Poland, Żywiec 0.0, HEINEKEN's third-largest 0.0 brand, grew by 36% in 2024, driven by its botanical flavoured zero range, which nearly doubled volumes with raspberry and mint line extensions.

### Layout and Structure
The page is organized into a main content area on the right and a narrow vertical navigation bar on the left.

The main content area is primarily text-based, divided into three main sections, each with a bolded heading: "Desperados – the beer with Latin vibe", "Sol – sun-powered positivity", and "Pioneering choice in low and no-alcohol". The text is presented in a multi-column layout, with the first two sections ("Desperados" and "Sol") spanning two columns each, and the "Pioneering choice" section spanning three columns. Paragraphs are justified.

The left navigation bar is dark green at the top with "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" and the page number "14". Below this, there are light grey boxes with section titles: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board" (dark green), "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information". At the bottom of the navigation bar, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing arrow, a downward-pointing arrow, and three horizontal lines, followed by a refresh icon.

The bottom half of the page is dominated by a large, dynamic image that spans across the entire width, underlying the text columns. This image features people interacting with and holding bottles of Desperados and Sol beers, and a separate product shot of Heineken 0.0 and Żywiec 0.0.

**Chief Executive's Q&A**

**Our EverGreen formula for growth**

**What are your top reflections on 2024?**
We delivered strong top and bottom-line performance while investing in the future. I'm proud of our 85,000 employees: volatility remains, but we're navigating it with agility and resilience.

Beer volume grew organically in all regions, with net revenue (beia) increasing organically by 5%. We gained or held market share in more than half our markets, driven by growth in Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Vietnam. Led by Heineken® and complemented by international and local premium brands like Birra Moretti, Desperados and Kingfisher Ultra, premium beer volume grew organically in the mid-single digits.

We continued to pioneer choice in low and no-alcohol (LONO) beverages, with portfolio volume growth in high single-digits and Heineken® 0.0 further consolidating its position as the world's #1 non-alcoholic beer brand.

With operating profit (beia) growth of 8.3%, we're delivering strong financials while also investing in the future through big investments in marketing and digitalisation.

**How is HEINEKEN delivering on its EverGreen strategy?**
Our EverGreen strategy aims to drive superior balanced growth while future-proofing the business.

We're driving premiumisation at scale, led by Heineken®. Alongside our sponsorship platforms, investments in campaigns like 'Heineken® The 1st Ahhh! and 'The boring phone' delivered premium organic beer volume growth of 5%.

To fund growth, we delivered €0.6 billion in gross savings in 2024, surpassing our €0.5 billion target. Productivity gains from supplier collaborations, procurement, digitalisation and transport optimisation allowed reinvestment in innovation, brand strength, digital transformation and sustainability.

We made progress against our Brew a Better World 2030 ambitions, reducing Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 34% and Scope 3 by 14%. In total 39% of our volumes were sold in reusable format and we have 44% recycled content in bottles and cans.

Our digital transformation continued in 2024 with investment in our eBusiness platforms and our Digital Backbone (DBB). Leveraging data across almost all our operating companies, we deployed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver insights that enhance productivity, customer satisfaction and agility.

People drive our success. To strengthen our winning culture, we launched LEAD, our global people manager initiative, and HEINEKEN's Women's Summit, a development programme for senior female leaders. These are accelerating our existing talent and leadership development initiatives.

**"Our EverGreen strategy is delivering top and bottom-line performance while investing in the future."**

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured with a vertical navigation bar on the left, a large central image, and two columns of text on the right.

- **Left Sidebar:** A narrow green sidebar runs vertically along the left edge. At the top, it displays the page number "3" and "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024". Below this, there's a list of navigation items: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", and "Sustainability Statements", "Other Information". The "Report of the Executive Board" item is highlighted in a darker green, indicating the current section. At the bottom of the sidebar are small green icons for navigation: an upward arrow, a downward arrow, a horizontal three-line menu icon, and a circular refresh/undo icon.
- **Main Content Area:** This area occupies the majority of the page.
    - **Top Left:** The main title "Chief Executive's Q&A" is at the top, followed by a large, bold headline "Our EverGreen formula for growth".
    - **Central Image:** A large, full-height image dominates the left and central parts of the page, extending behind some of the text.
    - **Text Columns (Right):** Two columns of text are positioned on the right side of the page, overlaying a lighter green, wave-like graphic element that originates from the central image. The text is divided into two main sections with bold green headings: "What are your top reflections on 2024?" and "How is HEINEKEN delivering on its EverGreen strategy?".
    - **Quote:** A large, italicized quote attributed to Dolf van den Brink, Chief Executive Officer, is placed over the central image in the lower-left quadrant.

The overall design uses a dark green background for the main image and a lighter green for the text columns, with white text for readability. The layout is dynamic, with text flowing around and over visual elements.

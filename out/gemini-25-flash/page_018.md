**Business priority**
**Raise the bar on sustainability and responsibility**

We recognise that our activities have both negative and positive impacts on the environment and society. Since 2021, our Brew a Better World 2030 strategy has been the foundation for driving progress towards a net zero, fairer and more balanced world.

As we achieved some of our 2023 goals, we refined our approach. We remain focused on our three pillars – Environmental, Social and Responsible, and continue working within our business and across our value chain to drive transformational and long-term change.

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured with a left-hand navigation bar and a dominant right-hand content area.

The left-hand side features a narrow, dark green vertical bar containing the page number "18" at the top, followed by company and report details ("Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024"). Below this are a series of navigation links, each in a light grey rectangular button, indicating sections of the report: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information". At the very bottom of this bar are three small icons: an upward arrow, a downward arrow, a horizontal three-line menu icon, and a circular refresh/reload icon. The "Report of the Executive Board" navigation link is highlighted in a darker green, indicating it's the current section.

The right two-thirds of the page is dominated by a large, full-height photograph that serves as the background for most of the content. Overlaid on this photograph are several text blocks and a circular diagram.

The top right corner features a large, bright green rectangular block with rounded corners, containing the main heading "Business priority Raise the bar on sustainability and responsibility". Below this, two paragraphs of explanatory text are presented in white font directly on the photographic background.

In the lower left quadrant, overlaid on the photograph, is a large quote in white, italicized text, attributed to "Pedro Sousa". Below the quote, a small, light green rectangular button with rounded corners and a lightbulb icon prompts "Read more about the zero emissions ambition in Portugal".

In the lower right, a small, dark green rectangular block with rounded corners provides a disclaimer/reference to other pages for more information.

A large circular diagram is positioned in the lower right, partially overlapping the text and the background image.

The overall layout is clean and modern, using a strong green color palette consistent with the Heineken brand.

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured with a left-hand navigation bar and a large main content area.

The left navigation bar, approximately 15% of the page width, is light grey with white text for most menu items, except for "Report of the Executive Board" which is highlighted in green with white text, indicating the current section. At the top of this bar is the page number "16" in large black font. Below the navigation items, at the bottom left, are three small icons: an upward-pointing triangle, a downward-pointing triangle, and a three-horizontal-line "hamburger" menu icon, followed by a circular arrow icon.

The main content area, occupying about 85% of the page, features a large photograph as its background. The top right corner of this area contains a green overlay box with white text, detailing the "Business priority." Below this, a large quote from Stephanie Peregrin is presented in white text, overlaid on the photograph, with a large opening quotation mark. A smaller, light green call-to-action button is located at the bottom center of the page, also overlaid on the photograph.

The overall layout is clean and modern, with a strong visual emphasis on the photograph and the key strategic message. The green and white color scheme, consistent with the Heineken brand, is prominent.

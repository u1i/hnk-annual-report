We're continuing to increase our investment in digital transformation to build a future-proof company. To become the best-connected brewer, HEINEKEN needs to digitalise its route-to-consumer, unlock the value of data, simplify and automate end-to-end processes, build a secure and modern technology landscape, and create a digitally enabled organisation.

This year we've successfully gone live with our Digital Backbone – our biggest ever digital transformation – which enables us to standardise and modernise our business and ways of working.

“To maximise AI's impact, we prioritise customer-centric AI products that are seamlessly integrated into our operations and widely adopted by end-users at HEINEKEN. Supported with robust capabilities that enhance AI literacy, this will pave the way for a shift from everyday AI to game-changing AI.”

### Layout and Structure
The page has a two-column layout, with a narrow left sidebar and a dominant right section. The background is a large photograph of a bar setting.

The left sidebar, in dark green, contains the page number "26" at the top, followed by the company name and report title. Below this, there is a vertical navigation menu with sections like "Introduction," "Report of the Executive Board," "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial Statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other Information." These menu items are stacked vertically, with "Report of the Executive Board" highlighted in a brighter green box. At the very bottom of the sidebar, there are three small icons: an upward arrow, a downward arrow, a horizontal three-line menu icon, and a refresh/circular arrow icon.

The main content area on the right is dominated by a large image. Overlaid on the right side of this image is a large, bright green rectangular box with rounded corners, containing the main heading and a block of text. Below this, on the image itself, is a large quote in white text, followed by the speaker's name and title. At the bottom center, there is a horizontal, rounded rectangular button with text and a small icon.

The overall design is modern, with a strong visual emphasis on the photograph and the green brand color.

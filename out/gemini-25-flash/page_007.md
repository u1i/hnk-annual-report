### Layout and Structure
The page is divided into a main content area on the right and a narrow, green sidebar on the left.

The top left of the main content area contains the page number "7". Below it, in the sidebar, are the document title "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" and a navigation menu. The navigation menu is structured vertically with distinct sections: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information". Below these, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing arrow, a downward-pointing arrow, and a three-line "hamburger" menu icon, followed by a circular arrow icon. The current section "Report of the Executive Board" is highlighted in a darker green box within the sidebar.

The main content area features the large title "Executive Team" at the top. Below the title, there is a paragraph describing the team's role and composition. To the right of this text, and slightly below it, is a green-shaded box containing a list of names and titles, organized into three columns, with the heading "From left to right:".

The majority of the page's lower two-thirds is dominated by a large photograph of the Executive Team. The text content and the green box with names are overlaid on the top portion of this photograph, which has a gradient overlay to ensure readability. The "Heineken" logo is visible in the background of the photo, above the team members.

**Logistics**
Most of our products are produced in the countries where they're consumed. We manage profitability by enhancing productivity in our warehouses, carefully selecting third-party carriers and optimising our transport network.

This is supported by our digital transformation programme and the ongoing replacement of existing fragmented technologies with a modern, modular architecture and standardised cloud-based platforms. This helps us improve ways of working, transport planning, and warehouse management. Scaling these capabilities across our operations helps us improve customer experience, drive end-to-end efficiencies, reduce emissions and save costs.

**Customers**
Our customers include retailers, wholesalers and distributors, bars, restaurants and clubs where consumers enjoy moments of connection and celebration. In some countries, such as the UK, Mexico and Egypt, we also own and operate bars and retail outlets.

Our scale combined with new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions helps us continuously improve customer experiences and grow revenues. Digital innovation is providing insight that transforms sales representatives into strategic business advisors and delivers personalised recommendations to customers, boosting sales on our eB2B platform. Elsewhere, increasingly connected outlets are helping customers automate stock replenishment and optimise inventory.

At the bottom of the left sidebar, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing arrow, a downward-pointing arrow, and a three-line "hamburger" icon, followed by a refresh/loop icon.

The main content area is structured into a prominent title "Our business model" at the top. Below the title, there's a horizontal bar with two green oval-shaped buttons labeled "Operations" and "Downstream", separated by a series of dots.

The core content is presented in three vertical columns, each dedicated to a segment of the business model: "Logistics", "Customers", and "Consumers". Each column features a large, rounded-corner image at the top, followed by a heading and detailed descriptive text. Below the text, each column has a quantitative data point in a large, bold font, followed by a brief description. The "Logistics" and "Customers" columns also include a circular chart each, positioned below their respective quantitative data.

At the bottom right of the page, there's a rectangular call-out box with a green leaf icon and text, providing a cross-reference.

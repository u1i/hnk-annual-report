# Africa and Middle East

## Challenges
## and growth

2024 was a year of resilience and
growth for the Africa Middle East
(AME) region. To manage significant
economic volatility, social instability
and inflationary pressures, HEINEKEN
focused on courageous pricing,
disciplined cost management, prudent
investments and innovative brand
building to deliver balanced
performance and position our business
for long-term growth.

### Navigating a tough environment
We remain committed to our long-term vision for
AME, however, we faced significant headwinds in
2024 including major currency devaluations in
Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt, and widespread
inflation that pressurised consumer purchasing
power. Social unrest further complicated operations
in countries like Ethiopia, the DRC, Kenya and
Mozambique. HEINEKEN mitigated these challenges
with courageous pricing, strict cost management
and a prudent approach to investment, enabling the
region to achieve both organic profit growth and
volume growth.

Nigerian Breweries activated its Business Recovery
Plan, including a successful rights issue, company-
wide reorganisation and the temporary suspension
of two of its nine breweries.
It also completed the acquisition of Distell Nigeria,
providing access to a complementary portfolio of
fast-growing wine and spirit brands. These steps
helped achieve volume growth and laid the
foundations for a return to profitability.

We further optimised our footprint with the sale of
Champion Breweries in Nigeria and the announcement
of the construction of a state-of-the-art brewery in Dubai
through Sirocco, our long-standing joint venture with
Maritime and Mercantile International. This first large-
scale facility in the Gulf region will support Dubai's
burgeoning tourism industry.

"I'm proud of all our teams who
demonstrated resilience and
resourcefulness in the face of a
volatile macro-economic environment.
Courageous pricing, cost
management and smart investments
helped us navigate the storm and
deliver organic profit growth.
Crucially, our strong brand portfolio
and focus on consumers helped return
AME to organic volume growth."

**Roland Pirmez**
Regional President, Africa Middle East

In South Africa, we made important steps to
complete the integration of the acquired Distell
business, with encouraging results across the
portfolio. Strong growth in cider was led by Savanna,
including the launch of a premium, whisky-flavoured
cider, Savanna Neat. The launch of a new spritzer,
Bernini Mimosa, reinforced the brand's strong
position with women. It was a positive year of growth
for Namibia Breweries, which also benefited from the
integration of the Distell portfolio.

Elsewhere, we took significant steps forward to
become the best-connected brewer with the
successful roll-out of pilots of our new Digital
Backbone (more on this on page 29) in two AME
operating companies that simplify our IT landscape
and drive productivity.

### Premiumisation and innovation
We drove premiumisation at scale led by the
Heineken® brand, which enjoyed consistent volume
growth across the region. Our affordable premium
brands expanded into new markets with launches
like Amstel in Algeria and Tiger in the DRC.
Desperados continued its upward trajectory,
particularly in Nigeria.

Local icons also played a pivotal role in
strengthening HEINEKEN's presence. Life and
Goldberg delivered impressive growth in Nigeria,
while Maltina's 'Share Kindness-Share Happiness'
campaign revitalised consumer engagement. A
refreshed identity for Turbo King resonated strongly,
achieving solid growth in key markets.

### Sustainability
Most of the beer we sell in AME is in returnable glass
bottles. In 2024 we made a further step in our carbon
reduction journey with the launch of the Heineken®
'Star' returnable bottle in South Africa and introduced
public spaces called 'Green Zones' across the country.
In Nigeria, we celebrated an important milestone with
the signing of a PPA to supply two off-grid breweries
with 100% renewable electricity. Our agricultural
footprint in Africa continues to grow, with over 60% of
raw materials locally sourced, including five OpCos
that sourced more than 75% locally for the first time.
We continued to invest in our people with 75% of
senior managers being from the region and 30%
being women.

### HEINEKEN Africa Foundation
The HEINEKEN Africa Foundation continued its
mission to empower small-scale farmers through
regenerative agriculture. Pilot projects in Burundi and
Ethiopia progressed significantly in 2024 and there
are plans underway for a new initiative in
Mozambique in 2025. By 2027, the Foundation
aims to impact over 47,000 farming families across
these countries, fostering climate resilience and
sustainable livelihoods.

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured into a main content area on the right and a narrow left sidebar.
The left sidebar contains navigational elements: the page number "34" at the top, followed by "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" and a list of report sections ("Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", "Other Information"). Below these, there are three small icons: an upward arrow, a downward arrow, and a horizontal three-line icon (hamburger menu), and a refresh icon, likely for navigation within a digital document.

The main content area is divided into three primary columns for text, though the content does not strictly adhere to these columns throughout.
- The first column on the left starts with the main heading "Africa and Middle East" and a large sub-heading "Challenges and growth". This section includes an introductory paragraph and a sub-section "Navigating a tough environment".
- The second column, starting below the main heading, contains text about Nigerian Breweries and the Dubai brewery project. Below this text, there is a headshot image of Roland Pirmez, followed by a large quote attributed to him.
- The third column, on the far right, begins with text about South Africa and Digital Backbone initiatives. Below this, it introduces "Premiumisation and innovation" and "Sustainability" sections.
- The "HEINEKEN Africa Foundation" section spans across the second and third columns at the bottom right.

Visual elements are integrated into the text flow:
- A headshot of Roland Pirmez is placed in the second column, centered below the text about the Dubai brewery.
- A product image of a Savanna cider bottle is placed at the bottom left, partially overlapping the text columns and extending into the green wave background.
- An image of two people working at computers is placed in the bottom middle, also overlapping text columns and the green wave.
- An image of two women with Maltina products is placed at the bottom right, with a tagline "Show kindness, share happiness" and images of Maltina cans.

The page uses a clean, sans-serif font. Headings are larger and in a dark green color, while body text is black. The background features a subtle green wave pattern at the bottom, which visually connects the images.

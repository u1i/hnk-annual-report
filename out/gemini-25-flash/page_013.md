**International brands**

**Amstel – share your true selves and bond with friends**

Amstel is HEINEKEN's second-largest international beer brand and one of the fastest-growing globally. Available in more than 80 markets, it continues to resonate with consumers through offering an accessible premium experience that turns ordinary gatherings into meaningful moments of connection. Fuelled by strong volume and equity gains across our Americas, Africa and Middle East regions, Amstel achieved mid single-digit revenue growth in 2024.

We reinforced Amstel's brand strength through innovative campaigns and product launches. Two activations celebrated our brand's heritage. In Brazil, 'I Amstel' promoted authenticity and freedom, encouraging people to be themselves among friends, while 'Amstel Spirit of Amsterdam' offered a tribute to Dutch King's Day.

Elsewhere in Latin America, our sponsorships of the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana celebrated the passions that unite friends and how the act of cheering shows your genuine self. Music also played a pivotal role, with the Friends of Amstel event in the Netherlands and South Africa combining entertainment and brand storytelling.

Product innovations expanded Amstel's appeal to underserved consumers, including launches of Amstel Grande in India, Amstel Extra in China, Amstel Rosé 0.0% in the Netherlands and Amstel Radler in South Africa, and relaunches of Amstel Original in Peru and Paraguay. We will continue our focus on boosting brand power in 2025, offering a premium proposition at an accessible price, extending our footprint and welcoming even more consumers into Amstel's world of genuine connections.

**Birra Moretti – enjoy life's simple pleasures**

Since 1859, Birra Moretti has stood as a symbol of authentic Italian heritage, building relevance through celebrating life's simple pleasures. As one of Europe's fastest-growing premium beer brands, it continues to expand its presence globally, delighting consumers in more than 40 markets beyond Italy.

In 2024, we launched a new Enjoy Life's Simple Pleasures campaign highlighting how Italians, with a touch of playful ingenuity, find joy in even the simplest moments. To further boost perceptions, we unveiled a product-focused campaign highlighting how Birra Moretti's taste, refreshment and craftsmanship is 'worth pulling up a chair for'. Later in the year, our first-ever Christmas campaign – featuring a decorated ape and the tagline 'Enjoy Life's Simple Pleasures this Festive Season' – helped drive growth at this critical calendar moment. 2024 also marked the international expansion of our portfolio with the launch of Sale di Mare in the UK and Romania.

Looking ahead, Birra Moretti will continue to bring loved ones together to share moments of good food, good company and great beer.

**Tiger – you never roar alone**

Since its launch in 1932 on the streets of Singapore, Tiger has been inspiring boldness and progress, earning its place as the #1 international premium beer in Asia.

In 2024, Tiger embraced the power of the collective through a new brand platform, You Never Roar Alone, built on a belief that progress isn't a solo journey, but one fuelled by the strength and support of your community.

This platform inspired a refresh of the iconic Tiger visual identity, with striking packaging updates rolling out across key Asian markets, and a series of innovative partnerships. Tiger became the Official Beer Partner of Manchester United, launching with co-branded watch parties, exclusive matchday experiences and, in 2025, the first-of-its-kind street football events across Asia and beyond. In December, Tiger further expanded its football presence by becoming the Official International Beer Partner of Tottenham Hotspur.

From igniting consumers, their passions and communities to uncaging bold new designs, Tiger continues to redefine the beer category with an unwavering focus on 'uncaging your Tiger' through connection, innovation and progress, making sure its roar is heard across its 60 markets and beyond.

### Layout and Structure
The page is organized into a two-column layout. The left column is a narrow navigation bar, and the right column contains the main content.

The navigation bar on the left features the page number "13" at the top, followed by "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" stacked vertically. Below this, there's a list of report sections, each in a separate box: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information". The active section, "Report of the Executive Board," is highlighted in green. At the bottom of the navigation bar, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing green triangle, a downward-pointing green triangle, and three horizontal lines, followed by a circular arrow icon.

The main content area on the right is structured into three primary sections, each dedicated to a different beer brand: Amstel, Birra Moretti, and Tiger. Each brand section begins with a bolded green heading, followed by narrative text in multiple paragraphs. The text is justified, creating clean edges.

Visually, the bottom half of the page is dominated by a large, dynamic image that spans across both columns, creating a continuous visual flow underneath the text. This image integrates product shots of the featured beers with scenes related to their brand messaging. A green, wavy, translucent graphic element underlies the entire page, starting from the bottom left and extending upwards and to the right, adding a sense of movement and brand continuity.

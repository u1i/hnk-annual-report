**Risk management**

**Leadership, talent and capabilities**

**What could happen?**
Our EverGreen ambition requires us to unlock the full potential of our people and organisation. If HEINEKEN is not successful in intentionally attracting, developing, retaining and promoting diverse talent to build strong succession for leadership and other critical management roles, it could have an impact on business continuity and results.

**Recent developments**
We are on a journey of continued investment in leadership development while further strengthening our internal talent review processes and local talent acquisition functions and empowering our people to build skills for today & the future. This will ensure we have a strong talent pipeline to deliver the right talent in the right roles at the right time supported by leaders who can drive sustainable business growth.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
Talent Management remains one of the strategic capabilities to deliver our EverGreen Strategy. Our potential model remains our common language for understanding strengths and growth opportunities for our talents. In 2024, we refreshed our Talent Review process powered by this model improving both our ability to identify talent, and also our ability to help them realise their potential through their personal development plans. This translated into proactive identification, validation & acceleration of global talent pools through intentional development opportunities.
We launched our Global Graduate Program in 2024 to further strengthen our pipeline of high-calibre, homegrown, diverse talent for senior roles and continued utilizing our Senior Leader Assessment & Development Centre. Our Talent Acquisition & Talent Management Global Communities of Practice have been further embedded to build and strengthen talent capability across our operating companies.
In 2024 we rolled out LEAD – a new global People Manager program – designed to support our ~15,000 people managers to become even more effective at developing their people and building strong talent pipelines for the future.
In addition, our inclusion and diversity network continues to build an inclusive and equitable environment in HEINEKEN where everyone feels valued. We also achieved external recognition by the World Economic Forum who selected HEINEKEN's Women in Sales initiative as a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Lighthouse.

**Health and safety**

**What could happen?**
HEINEKEN aims to provide a healthy and safe workplace for all employees, temporary workers and contractors. Despite the controls in place, HEINEKEN employees, temporary workers, contractors and visitors may be impacted by uncontrolled events in the brewery, supply chain, route-to-market or in our offices, which could lead to illnesses, serious injuries or fatalities potentially followed by business disruption, losses, reputational or legal claims.

**Recent developments**
Despite our continuous efforts to provide safe working conditions, in 2024 we still experienced incidents with significant safety impact on our premises, including events resulting in two fatal accidents, involving one employee and one contractor, underlining the importance of realizing further improvements in the area of safety, health and well-being.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
Our Safety, Health and Well-being strategy reflects our company value of Care. We focus on shaping a pro-active Health & Safety culture fully embedded in our ways of working, counting on everyone's leadership, engagement and participation. Throughout the Company, the HEINEKEN Life Saving Commitments target the activities that carry the greatest safety risks to employees, temporary workers and contractors. In 2024 we have also deployed significant resources in both time and effort to remove potential risks to safety, such as the switch from motorbikes to cars and introduction of pedestrian 'no crossing' zones and road bridges in breweries.
As the availability of quality (emergency) healthcare services varies across the large number of countries and regions in which we operate, ensuring access to quality medical care to our national and international employees and their family members remains a priority.
To ensure healthcare coverage, HEINEKEN counts on a number of health professionals in countries and regions where healthcare services are not adequate. Those employees and dependents have access to broad medical services including screening and lab tests, medicines and pharmacy, health benefits, disease prevention and health promotion projects, emergency evacuations, health training and education.
Within the health area, mental health has been identified as an area of continued focus. To address this risk, we keep investing in our internal well-being programs to ensure the wellbeing of our employees and contractors.

**Product safety and integrity**

**What could happen?**
Poor quality or contamination of HEINEKEN products, be it accidental or malicious, could lead to health risks, reputational damage, financial liabilities, supply chain disruption and product recalls.

**Recent developments**
The environment we operate in is constantly evolving. Changes in our product portfolio, increasing awareness of (new) potential food hazards, rising consumer concerns over food safety, social media and a more complex legal framework require ongoing efforts to adapt and respond. Ensuring food safety for our consumers remains a top priority.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
HEINEKEN has established a comprehensive Company-wide Quality Assurance program that addresses employee competencies, production standards, recipe management, supplier governance and production material risk management. Continuous improvement is driven through global compliance monitoring and systematic gap-analysis.
All our production units, including outsourced production of HEINEKEN brands, are required to implement an external certified Food Safety Management System in compliance with GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative) standards. In 2024 97% of our breweries have a certified Food Safety System with the rest also applying the HACCP methodology. The same requirement is in place for implementation of a Quality Management System certified under ISO9001 and as at the end of 2024 over 90% of our breweries have an ISO9001 certificate, with more expected to be certified next year. All raw, auxiliary and packaging materials must be sourced from approved suppliers and meet our Production Material Specifications. Every product must follow a Basic Recipe, adhering to our Recipe Governance standards.
In the event of a risk, global recall and crisis procedures are in place to mitigate the impact. Every production unit, including outsourced production of HEINEKEN brands, has the capability to block and/or recall products and complies to the HEINEKEN Traceability standard. Compliance to our standards is ensured through self-assessments and Global Supply Chain compliance audits, while annual integrity surveys check final products for known contaminants to verify the effectiveness of these standards.
Additionally, HEINEKEN stays ahead of emerging legislation and risks by working closely with partners, suppliers and external scientific institutions to implement proactive measures that prevent such risks.

**Supply chain continuity**

**What could happen?**
Supply chain disruptions such as those for the Red Sea shipping routes can have far-reaching consequences, including the potential inability to fulfil orders for crucial clients, financial setbacks, harm to brand reputation, and a decline in market presence. Substantial fluctuations in the accessibility or pricing of essential inputs such as raw materials, commodities, transportation, energy and water may precipitate either shortages in supply or elevated operational expenses.

**Recent developments**
The global supply chain landscape continues to deal with disruptions and risk of further escalation, e.g. Suez Canal closure. Throughout the year, we have observed several instances where our suppliers have been adversely affected by these events, resulting in price volatility and contractual challenges. The availability of certain critical resources has become constrained, driven by factors like climate change, and the prevailing global political instability.
Furthermore, the growing concerns of climate change and increasing water shortages are starting to have effects on how much crops can grow, the availability of resources and the prices of grains. Considering these developments, it is imperative for both markets and governments to proactively address these challenges, implementing measures to adapt and respond effectively.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
HEINEKEN has effectively minimised the impact of disruptions by leveraging its extensive global presence and strong supplier relationships across various regions and product categories. Our agile sourcing approach (including our geographic spread of sourcing and local sourcing), combined with the adaptability of our breweries worldwide, has ensured the uninterrupted flow of supplies across our global operations.
We've taken proactive measures to safeguard business continuity by devising comprehensive plans for HEINEKEN's flagship brands in all critical markets, along with implementing contingency plans within our operational entities. Our resilience is further reinforced by our ownership of strategic malt production facilities, long-term procurement contracts, meticulous water management strategies, and centralised oversight of global insurance policies.
HEINEKEN has adopted a watershed-centric strategy aimed at preserving water resources. Sustainable sourcing is a top priority within our Brew a Better World 2030 initiative, reflecting our dedication to making a positive impact on the environment and society.

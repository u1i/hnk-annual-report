**Shape the future of beer and beyond**

**Driving premiumisation at scale with Heineken®**

Present in over 190 countries and delivering growth in 2024, Heineken® continues to solidify its position as the world's most global beer brand. This success stems from a commitment to empower meaningful consumer connections, champion 'social life' at the heart of our messaging and embrace creativity as a cornerstone of our communications.

Key markets like Brazil and Vietnam led exceptional brand growth, with more than half of operating companies reporting volume increases and more than a quarter achieving double-digit growth.

Our creativity was celebrated globally. Heineken® earned the title of the most creative alcoholic drinks brand and the second most creative brand across all categories at the prestigious Cannes Lions, taking home a record 22 awards in 2024. The power of creativity was evident in the brand growing in value by 18% across the year.

But premiumisation isn't just about creativity: it's also about a deep and consistent commitment to quality. Our 'The First Ahhh!' campaign highlighted our dedication to the craft of brewing and the joy and refreshment of the first sip of a crisp Heineken®.

**The more refreshing your social life, the more rewarding**

Our goal continues to be establishing Heineken® as the undisputed leader in the beer category for brand value. We will achieve this by acting as a champion of quality socialising, inspiring a more open and inclusive social life. Our brand communications focus on tackling the barriers to meaningful social connections, as seen in groundbreaking campaigns throughout 2024.

During Milan Design Week, Heineken® introduced 'The Boring Phone' in collaboration with HMD and BODEGA. This stripped-down mobile device encouraged consumers to stay present during nights out, resonating with younger audiences who often find themselves distracted by 'doomscrolling'. With 9.5 billion organic opportunities to see (OTS) across 120 countries, the campaign boosted the brand's associations with innovation and uniqueness, driving sales in key markets with the key message 'there's more to social life when there's less on your phone.'

On International Beer Day, our 'Forgotten Beers' campaign reminded consumers that the most important part of enjoying Heineken® is the social moments enjoyed with it. Launched in over 50 markets, the campaign reached 150 million OTS through earned media, reinforcing the brand's role in creating wonderful moments of socialisation.

Through its sponsorships of both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, Heineken® has advanced its mission to make football more inclusive and welcoming for all fans, everywhere. Our 'Cheers to the Real Hardcore Fans' campaign challenged stereotypes about fandom while celebrating the passion and behaviour of true supporters.

Tackling the barriers to socialising isn't just about social issues – it's about protecting social environments, too. In Ireland, the 'PubMuseums' campaign, part of our Back the Bars initiative, aimed to provide pubs with opportunities and resources usually reserved for other cultural landmarks. Supporting pubs with a digital twist to preserve their heritage in a fresh, modern way, we garnered global acclaim for advertising rooted in this genuine cultural insight.

**Moderation matters**

Heineken® continues to lead the way in promoting responsible consumption through its global partnership with F1™ and the 'When You Drive Never Drink' initiative, amplified by Max Verstappen, now a four-time world champion. With F1™ being one of the fastest-growing sports and entertainment platforms today, our efforts have significantly expanded the audience for Heineken® 0.0 and our 'Always a Choice' message.

Present in 117 countries, Heineken® 0.0 remains at the forefront of the non-alcoholic beer (NAB) category and is a driving force in making NAB options accessible and desirable for everyone, everywhere. In 2024, innovation in draught systems to make sure Heineken 0.0® can be served from the tap alongside alcoholic beers was crucial to normalising its consumption.

Addressing social stigmas around low and no-alcohol beverages, Heineken® launched research with Professor Spence of the University of Oxford revealing that 21% of Gen Z conceal drinking NAB due to fear of judgement. We'll challenge this stigma in 2025 with our '0.0 Reasons Needed' campaign, empowering consumers to enjoy Heineken® 0.0 for its great taste – no reason needed!

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured into two main vertical sections. The left-most section is a narrow sidebar containing navigation links for the Annual Report, with the current page's context ("Report of the Executive Board") highlighted. The main content area occupies about 85% of the page width.

This main content area is further divided horizontally. The top portion features the page number "12" and the main title "Shape the future of beer and beyond." Below this, the text is organized into three distinct columns, each with a bolded green heading: "Driving premiumisation at scale with Heineken®", "The more refreshing your social life, the more rewarding", and "Moderation matters". Each section contains multiple paragraphs of explanatory text.

The bottom half of the page is dominated by large, vibrant photographic visuals that span across the width of the main content area, visually illustrating the themes discussed in the text. These images are integrated with some text overlays.

The layout uses a clean, modern aesthetic with ample white space around the text columns, enhancing readability. The green headings and elements in the images provide a consistent brand color.

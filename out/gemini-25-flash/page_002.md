### Layout and Structure
The page is primarily organized into two main columns. The left column, which is narrower, contains a vertical navigation bar with sections like "Introduction," "Report of the Executive Board," "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial Statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other Information." This navigation bar is green, matching the Heineken branding. Below the main navigation, there are four small green icons: an upward-pointing arrow, a downward-pointing arrow, three horizontal lines (hamburger menu icon), and a refresh/loop arrow.

The wider right column contains the main content. At the top, it features the page number "2" and the title "In this year's report." Below this, the content is structured into four main sections, each with a green heading: "Report of the Executive Board," "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other information." Each section lists various sub-topics with corresponding page numbers, forming a detailed table of contents.

Interspersed throughout the page are four small circular images with text captions and a "Read more..." call to action, each accompanied by a stylized icon (a hand with a lightbulb/spark). These visual elements are strategically placed to draw attention to key themes.

At the bottom right, there are two gray-shaded text boxes containing disclaimers and information about the report's format and availability. The overall design uses a clean, modern aesthetic with ample white space and a consistent green color palette.

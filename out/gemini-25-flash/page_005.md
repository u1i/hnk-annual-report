### Layout and Structure
The page is dominated by a vibrant green background, with a narrow white sidebar on the left containing navigation links. The main content area is structured into two primary rows of information, each containing three distinct white-bordered boxes with rounded corners.

The top row features three financial/volume highlights: "Net revenue (beia)", "Operating profit (beia)", and "Consolidated beer volume". Each box displays a large key metric and a bar chart illustrating trends from 2020 to 2024.

The bottom row mirrors this structure with three more boxes: "Operating profit margin (beia)", "Net profit (beia)", and "Heineken® volume". These also feature a key metric and a bar chart (or illustrative visual for Heineken® volume) showing trends from 2020 to 2024.

To the right of these six main content boxes, a vertical column on the green background presents three key sustainability/social metrics: "Gender balance", "Carbon emissions", and "Average water usage". Below these, a large image of a Formula 1 race track with Heineken branding is displayed, followed by the "Responsible consumption" metric.

The page number "5" is prominently displayed in the top left corner. The company name and report title are below it in the white sidebar. The main title "Performance highlights Solid results with broad-based growth and profit expansion in 2024" spans across the top of the green content area.

The navigation sidebar on the left includes:
- Introduction
- Report of the Executive Board
- Report of the Supervisory Board
- Financial Statements
- Sustainability Statements
- Other Information
- Followed by three small icons: an upward arrow, a downward arrow, and a three-line menu icon, and a refresh icon at the very bottom.

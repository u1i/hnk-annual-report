### Safety, health
**and wellbeing**

Nothing matters more than the safety and wellbeing
of our people. We believe every single person who
works for and with us should benefit from a positive
and nourishing working environment and, above all,
return home safely each day. A range of activities in
2024 supported our ambition to shape a leading
health and safety culture.

Every year we run Safety Week, a global HEINEKEN
event that highlights our ongoing commitment to
safety, helping to raise awareness and embed the
right practices. This year's theme was 'Safety at Heart!'
A variety of initiatives emphasised the importance of
treating our own safety and that of our colleagues
with the same care we show for loved ones.

Elsewhere, the introduction of a cultural programme
in 2024 empowered all operating companies to
assess their health and safety culture, identify gaps
and develop improvement plans to close them. So
far, 49 locations have embraced the initiative with
more to follow in 2025.

We extended our transformation programme that
supports select functions and operational companies
based on safety performance. In Mexico for
example, a heat stress initiative was introduced after
an exceptionally hot summer affected employee
health. Measures such as additional breaks,
improved awareness of the importance of hydration,
adjusted shift management and facility upgrades
addressed and improved both safety and well being.

While we have significantly reduced the severity of
incidents across our business, we deeply regret that
two persons lost their lives while working for us in
2024. An independent investigation team
thoroughly investigates every fatality to understand
the root cause, and we take action to prevent
recurrence and share learnings. Looking ahead, we'll
continue to strengthen and embed an empowering
health and safety culture and integrate leadership
on safety across our business.

### Social
**sustainability**

We continued to advance our social sustainability
ambition in 2024 in pursuit of an ever fairer, more
equal and safer company – and society.

One initiative was the expansion of our global
Trusted Representatives programme, which fosters a
global community of more than 500 employees
dedicated to supporting colleagues who are
witnessing or experiencing potential misconduct.

This year, we ran training in two critical areas: fraud
and human rights.

We made significant progress on including waste
pickers in the citizenship agenda of economically
developing countries, improving their working
conditions and supporting our circularity strategy. In
Brazil, the HEINEKEN Institute partnered with local
authorities to enhance visibility and boost conditions
for waste pickers. What began as a state-level
initiative has evolved into a best practice model that
is receiving support from the Federal Government
for replication across six additional states as a
national public policy.

As the world's most international brewer, our
operations span diverse geographies including high-
risk and, at times, conflict-affected areas. In
Myanmar, heightened Human Rights Due Diligence
(hHRDD) was conducted across our value chain,
covering conflict risk, human rights evaluations and
management systems reviews. The findings
confirmed our ability to operate responsibly through
robust management systems while contributing to
the safety and economic stability of our employees,
their families and local communities.

Areas for improvement, particularly in inland
logistics, were addressed through collaboration with
suppliers to enhance safety and working conditions.
In more volatile regions, we refined our approach to
protecting people and communities near our
breweries through a refreshed approach to our
ongoing training for security forces in key Africa and
Middle East markets.

These efforts underscore our commitment to social
sustainability. Looking ahead to 2025, we'll focus on
strengthening value chain due diligence, making
sure we remain future-ready while upholding our
dedication to human rights.

"By empowering leaders and fostering
inclusion, we're not just building a
future-ready organisation – we're
creating a culture where innovation
and collaboration drive impact. Our
goal is to be a true enabler of our
EverGreen strategy, helping
HEINEKEN better connect with
consumers, deliver sustainable growth
and lead with purpose in a dynamic,
ever-changing world."

Chief People Officer

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured with a narrow left sidebar and a wide main content area. The sidebar contains navigation elements for the annual report, including the page number "32" at the top, followed by "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" and a list of sections: "Introduction," "Report of the Executive Board" (highlighted in green), "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial Statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other Information." Below these, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing arrow, a downward-pointing arrow, and a horizontal three-line menu icon, followed by a circular refresh-like icon.

The main content area is divided into two primary sections: "Safety, health and wellbeing" and "Social sustainability," each with a bold, green heading. The text is presented in a multi-column layout, with three columns for the "Safety, health and wellbeing" section and two columns for the "Social sustainability" section. The text flows naturally from left to right, top to bottom.

Visual elements are integrated into the lower half of the page, overlapping with the text columns and extending towards the bottom and right edges. A large quote from the Chief People Officer is prominently displayed in green text on the right side of the page, below a headshot image. The background of the lower half of the page features a subtle, wavy green and orange gradient pattern.

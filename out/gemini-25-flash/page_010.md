**Our strategic framework**
**Our strategy**

**EverGreen is a bold multi-year strategy that empowers us to adapt to a fast-changing world and future-proof the business.**

We brew more than just beer: we brew the joy of true togetherness to inspire a better world. With every pour, we create space for connection. With every moment shared, we create space for joy.

This is our purpose â€“ our reason for being. It shapes both our values and our dream to win the hearts of consumers by shaping the future of beer and beyond, guiding our actions in the short and long term. We're committed to empowering a more open-minded, meaningfully connected world, and building a company that can constantly renew, adapt and improve itself in service of this aim.

Inspired by this purpose, EverGreen is our strategy to deliver superior and balanced growth, which puts us on a journey of constant renewal and adaption.

This strategy focuses on five business priorities: enhancing our diverse portfolio of brands to cater for evolving tastes and needs; driving productivity that frees resources for investment in balanced growth; leveraging digital transformation to streamline our operations and deepen consumer connections; weaving our Brew A Better World ambitions into decision making; and helping our people thrive within a winning culture.

That's EverGreen, and through it we are positioned to meet short-term challenges, ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and create lasting value for all our stakeholders.

### Layout and Structure
The page is divided into two main vertical sections. The left section, approximately 15% of the page width, serves as a navigation sidebar with a dark green background and white text. It contains the page number, company name, report details, and a list of report sections. The right section, occupying the majority of the page, presents the strategic content.

The main content area is further structured into several logical blocks:
- A large title at the top left: "Our strategic framework" and "Our strategy".
- A bold introductory statement about the EverGreen strategy.
- Two columns of text providing detailed explanations of the strategy, its purpose, and business priorities.
- A large visual element on the right side of the page, structured with green-themed boxes and text, detailing "Our Purpose," "Our Values," "Our Dream," "Our Green Diamond," and "Our Business Priorities." This visual element has a rounded-corner white background.
- A large, full-bleed photograph occupies the bottom half of the page, extending behind the text columns and the green-themed visual element.

The page uses a combination of black background for the main text area and a white background for the strategic visual element, creating a strong contrast. The navigation sidebar is dark green. Green is a prominent accent color used for headings, icons, and graphical elements within the strategic visual.

### Visual References
- **Navigation Sidebar:** A vertical bar on the far left with sections like "Introduction," "Report of the Executive Board," "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial Statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other Information." It also includes navigation arrows and a refresh icon at the bottom.
- **Strategic Framework Diagram:** A multi-part diagram on the right side of the page, outlined in white with green accents, illustrating the company's purpose, values, dream, green diamond, and business priorities.
- **Background Image:** A large photograph of a person drinking from a can of Tiger beer, illuminated by neon lights, covering the lower half of the page.
- **Heineken EverGreen Logo:** A white logo at the bottom left, featuring a stylized tree with roots transforming into circuit board lines, and the text "HEINEKEN EverGreen".

### Digitalising our route to consumer

HEINEKEN has cherished its relationships with customers and consumers for more than 150 years. In a world where customers expect instant, personalised service online and consumers demand Netflix-style experiences across their interactions with all brands, we're building new digital capabilities to keep these connections strong.

This involves developing innovative online platforms for customers and embracing new digital consumer engagement models. Crucially, this digitisation journey is giving us access to better, richer data that we're using to further improve our service, optimise engagement and empower growth. While this journey is far from over, 2024 was a pivotal year.

### Revolutionising customer engagement

In 2024, we continued to put our customers at the centre of everything we do, reimagining how they interact with us across every touchpoint: through eB2B platforms, sales representatives, customer service agents and distributors.

'eazle', the brand name and identity for our eB2B platforms, aims to make our customers' business easy. As part of our journey to create an integrated, end-to-end platform across all key touchpoints and reimagine the customer experience, eazle has so far been launched in four markets. The approach is already bearing fruit: over the course of 2024, the platform achieved close to €13 billion in gross merchandise value, connecting with 670,867 active customers and accounting for 70% of fragmented trade revenue – up from 60% in 2023.

Crucially, our success in driving up the number of customers engaging with us through digital channels is supporting the acceleration of wider data-driven innovation to deliver better service for customers and growth for HEINEKEN.

Beyond engagement, we continued to pioneer smart solutions to drive efficiencies for both customers and our business. Experiments with connected outlets allowed us to automate stock replenishment in bars, while continued investment in shelf image recognition technology is helping retailers optimise their inventory.

Our digitisation of customer experience is dramatically improving our customer relationships. Our customer NPS scores have increased steadily over the years to 68 in 2024.

### Deepening consumer connections

Alongside our customer initiatives, we're harnessing digital innovation to help create richer, more meaningful and personalised experiences for consumers – and deliver growth.

In 2024, we supported our brand teams in launching consumer-facing applications that resonate with our diverse global audiences. The Player 0.0 app, for example, embedded HEINEKEN in the gaming community by leveraging our ambassador Max Verstappen through our Formula 1 campaign. Elsewhere, Hei! helped consumers in cities organise social events effortlessly and discover new experiences and venues. Initiatives such as these not only delivered brand growth, but also generated valuable first-party consumer data that we use to optimise media spend and marketing activations.

As we digitise, our stakeholders' privacy is our priority. We have continued to invest in providing the necessary privacy protection around our consumers and their data in all our markets.

## Layout and Structure
The page is structured into two main vertical sections: a narrow left sidebar and a wider main content area.

The left sidebar contains navigation links for the Annual Report, with the current section "Report of the Executive Board" highlighted in green. Below the navigation links are four small icons (up arrow, down arrow, menu, reload), suggesting interactive navigation within a digital document.

The main content area is divided into three columns for text, with a large visual element (a collage of three images) occupying the bottom right portion of the page, overlapping with the text columns. The page number "27" is prominently displayed in the top left corner of the main content area. The main title "Become the best-connected brewer" spans across the top of the content area. Below this, there are three distinct sections with green headings: "Digitalising our route to consumer", "Revolutionising customer engagement", and "Deepening consumer connections". Each section contains multiple paragraphs of explanatory text. The text flows naturally from left to right, column by column, before encountering the large image collage at the bottom.

The overall design uses a clean, modern aesthetic with ample white space, and a consistent green color for headings and highlighted navigation elements, aligning with the Heineken brand.

## Appendix: Visual Elements

### Visual Element 1: Smartphone displaying "eazle" app
**Location:** Bottom left quadrant of the page, held by a hand extending from the bottom edge.
**Size:** Medium, occupying a significant portion of the lower left.
**Description:** A close-up shot of a hand, likely a person's right hand, holding a black smartphone. The phone screen is active and displays a dark teal-green interface with the "eazle" logo at the top center, followed by "Hi" and "Pub" with a dropdown arrow. Below this, there are three prominent white rectangular buttons with rounded corners, each containing an icon and text:
    *   Top button: A circular icon with a horizontal line and two vertical lines (resembling a stack) next to "Stock count".
    *   Middle button: A plus sign icon in a circle next to "Order".
    *   Bottom button: A document icon with lines next to "Financial".
Below these buttons, there's a smaller white box with rounded corners displaying "Next HEINEKEN delivery date" and "Wednesday 13 Sept" with a small green checkmark icon. Another smaller white box below it shows "Order cut off" and "Tuesday 12 Sept 15:30".
At the very bottom of the screen, there's a navigation bar with four small icons and labels: "Pub info", "Setup", "Training & Social Media", and "Contact Us".
The background behind the hand and phone is a blurred green and white pattern, suggesting a dynamic, almost liquid-like design.

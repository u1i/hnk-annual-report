**Business priority**
**Unlock the**
**full potential**
**of our people**

Our people are at the heart of our success and
are our top priority. With this in mind, our
strategy is grounded in four areas: future-
proofing our talent and organisation; driving
excellence to enhance processes and
competitiveness; unifying our people
approach globally; and protecting and
respecting every individual.

These areas guide our efforts to build a winning
culture where everyone thrives. We are
nurturing exceptional leaders, developing
inspired and purpose-driven teams, and
fostering an inclusive, equitable environment.

Crucially, we are committed to our people's
health, safety and wellbeing, and we will
continue working on our social sustainability
and human rights agenda.

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured with a prominent vertical sidebar on the left and a large main content area on the right, which is dominated by a photograph and overlaid text.

The left sidebar, colored dark green at the bottom and light grey at the top, contains the page number "30" at the very top, followed by the company name and report details ("Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024"). Below this, there's a navigation menu with sections like "Introduction," "Report of the Executive Board," "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial Statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other Information." The "Report of the Executive Board" section is highlighted in dark green, indicating it might be the current section. At the very bottom of the sidebar are three small icons: an upward arrow, a downward arrow, and a horizontal triple-line icon (hamburger menu), and a refresh/circular arrow icon, likely for navigation within the digital report.

The main content area is a full-page photograph of a woman, with text overlaid on top. The photograph occupies about two-thirds of the page width from the left, extending to the right edge. The rightmost third of the page is a solid green block with white text, representing a key business priority.

A large quote is positioned in the lower-left quadrant of the main content area, partially overlapping the photograph. Below the quote is the speaker's name and title. Further below, a small rectangular button with text and an icon is present.

The "Business priority" section is a large green rectangle on the right side of the page, with a rounded top-right corner. It contains a large white heading and several paragraphs of white text.

The overall design is clean and modern, using a strong green color palette consistent with the Heineken brand. The visual hierarchy is clear, with the large quote and the "Business priority" section standing out.

### On the path to an inclusive, fair and equitable world

We are working to create a fair and safe workplace for everyone. This means moving towards gender balance at senior levels, paying our employees globally a fair wage and creating fair living and working standards for third-party employees and Brand Promoters. Our safety, health and well-being strategy is focused on embedding a safety culture while our social impact initiatives align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals to ensure we have a meaningful impact on communities.

We are ranked #1 in the industry (#4 in 2023) and #67 overall (#78 in 2023) in the Forbes World's Best Employers ranking 2024, based on the views of more than 300,000 workers from over 50 countries.

### Embracing diversity, equity and inclusion

Embracing diversity, equity and inclusion fosters true togetherness and drives meaningful connections with our employees, consumers and customers. A diverse and inclusive workforce is good for our people and business as it sparks innovation and leads to better performance.

We believe everyone plays a role in championing a culture of belonging at HEINEKEN. Inclusion starts with courageous leadership, and we continue to foster an inclusive environment through training for leaders and colleagues on inclusive practices and a comprehensive engagement calendar. Employee resource groups like HEINEKEN Open and Proud (HOP), inclusion councils and ambassadors play key roles. They conduct listening and dialogue sessions with colleagues and help to fully embed our strategy across our operating companies. In 2024, 88% of HEINEKEN's operating companies had an inclusion council in place.

We achieved our 2025 goal a year early by having 30% of women in senior management in 2024. While we celebrate this important milestone, we still have work to do to achieve 40% by 2030 on the path to gender balance. We are strengthening our pipeline of women talent below senior management levels and ensuring performance based fair and equal opportunities in attracting, developing and promoting talent. Our global leadership development programme – Women Interactive Network or WIN – in partnership with IMD, has seen 290 women participate to date. In 2024, we launched the Women Summit, a leadership development programme for senior female talent in collaboration with WeQual.

Our operating companies play a key role in developing the female talent pipeline towards senior leadership. For example, UBL India has been on a journey from having zero women in senior management in 2021 to 27% in 2024. The Queenfisher campaign was initiated for female employees, recognising their talent, empowering them and even launching a limited edition of beer brewed and designed by women. In Mexico, the Inspirame programme is supporting women returning to work after a career break.

We work to ensure equal pay for equal work (or work of equal value) between female and male colleagues. We first achieved our goal of having 100% of our operating companies assessed and 100% action plans in place in 2023. In 2024, we continued to assess all operating companies and to track action plans to close any pay gaps. We also focused on ensuring equal representation, addressing new hires and opportunities for promotion. Actions included embedding structural checks and controls in processes to drive gender-neutral pay decisions. These efforts resulted in a pay gap of 2.3% in favour of men at the global level in 2024. This figure is significantly lower than the 5% threshold established by the EU Pay Transparency Directive and is in line with other industry leaders in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector.

### Layout and Structure
The page is divided into two main vertical sections. The left narrow column serves as a navigation sidebar, displaying "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" at the top, followed by navigation links: "Introduction," "Report of the Executive Board," "Report of the Supervisory Board," "Financial Statements," "Sustainability Statements," and "Other Information." Below these links are small navigation icons (up arrow, down arrow, menu icon, refresh/loop icon).

The main content area on the right occupies most of the page. The top portion features a large, full-width image. Below the image, the page is structured into two primary horizontal sections.

The upper horizontal section is further divided into four distinct vertical content blocks for "Africa and Middle East," "Americas," "Asia Pacific," and "Europe." Each block has a green heading, a "Read more" link to a specific page number, and a row of "Key brands" bottles displayed horizontally. A light green wave-like graphic forms the background behind the beer bottles across all four regional sections.

The lower horizontal section, titled "Regional performance snapshot," contains a large table of financial and volume data. Above this table, there are four circular donut charts, each representing a performance metric (Consolidated beer volume, Heineken® volume, Operating profit (beia), Net revenue (beia)). The table is aligned below these charts, with rows for each region and columns for 2024 and 2023 data, and the contribution to Group 2024.

The overall design uses a clean, modern aesthetic with a dominant black background for the top header and a light green background for the performance snapshot section, contrasting with white content blocks for the regional brand displays.

**Unlocking the value of data**

The cornerstone of all value generated by actionable insights, foresights and – of course – AI is a solid foundation of robust, trustworthy data. We have onboarded more than 70 operating companies on DataPrime, our foundational data platform, empowering us to connect data across our business and use it to greater effect, at scale.

Building on this, we advanced our data and AI capabilities in 2024, embedding AI-driven products across our operations and rolling out literacy programmes to ensure adoption. By treating data and insights as a strategic asset, we're creating AI with measurable impact on business performance.

**Data-driven commerce**

AI products are transforming our Global Commerce operations, helping us create incremental revenue opportunities and build a winning portfolio.

Artificial Intelligence Data-Driven Advisor (AIDDA) predicts the best actions to take with customers, accelerating the transformation of our sales representatives into true business advisors. In 2024, it scaled to eight markets, enhancing productivity with 490,000 daily customer engagements. Similarly, Product Recommender, now live in seven markets, analyses customer preferences and behaviours, delivering personalised suggestions to enhance user experience and drive sales on eazle. Falcon, our image recognition product, simplifies retail audits by checking planogram compliance. MERCURY is an AI product that optimises the impact of marketing spend across brands and channels. Having put it to use for above and below-the-line spend across all brands in 2024, it's delivering incremental gross profit across three markets.

Promo Advisor is our AI product suite for revenue management that enables the planning, simulation and optimisation of targeted promotions, boosting sales and ROI - all aligned with our promo strategy.

**Generative AI**

We piloted Generative AI (GenAI) with promising results in various areas across HEINEKEN.

Our Knowledge and Insights Management platform (KIM) unlocks consumer and customer research and insights across all markets, making it easily accessible to our Commerce operations.

Hoppy is a GenAI chatbot and integrates data from multiple internal sources to navigate global standards, ways of working and processes, boosting productivity within our Finance teams.

And finally: HeiFi leverages 10 years of data on the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) sector to offer strategic insights to leadership teams for better, quicker decision-making.

**Ethical AI**

Our Code of Business Conduct and our AI Ethics Principles offer guardrails to manage our ongoing use of AI and we continuously review our practices as technology evolves.

**Simplifying and automating our end-to-end business**

We're transforming the way we work by digitising, simplifying and automating our end-to-end processes. This commitment drives efficiency, enhances customer experience and keeps us competitive and sustainable for the long term.

At the heart of this effort is our Connected Brewery programme, which modernises breweries with a future-fit digital ecosystem. By integrating machine data and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, Connected Brewery optimises productivity, quality and sustainability while delivering recurring cost savings. It combines Smart Brewery, which connects machines to the cloud to reduce waste and maximise output, with Connected Worker apps that empower operators with tools like QR code scanning for instructions and augmented reality for remote support and problem-solving capabilities.

We significantly enhanced Connected Brewery in 2024. A key focus was on further incorporating robotics for crucial shop floor tasks including bringing our first Boston Dynamics Spot into full operation ('Spot' is a robotic dog that reduces energy consumption and prevents unplanned downtime through autonomous maintenance inspections to detect air leaks, heat emissions and mechanical anomalies). We also launched our first trials of automated bottle pickers.

We linked the programme with Total Productive Maintenance to improve equipment and maintenance reliability and standardised performance reporting across all breweries to cut administration workloads. We also made substantial investments to further enhance our Connected Worker Apps, which now include a personal skills development module for operators. Currently over 80% of our global production workforce has access to these shopfloor tools.

Connected Brewery now operates in over 90 breweries and plays a pivotal role in broader transformation initiatives including Sequoia, HEINEKEN's leading supply chain programme in Europe. With more than 7,000 connected machines generating billions of data points, Connected Brewery is key to creating the most sustainable and competitive supply chain in Europe.

Meanwhile, robotic process automation is streamlining repetitive tasks across all our support functions. In 2024, we saved more than 260,000 working hours - up from 200,000 in 2023 - putting us well on track to achieve our target of 1 million cumulative hours by 2025. This is freeing teams to focus on higher-value activities and scale innovation faster than ever before.

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured into a main content area on the right and a narrow left sidebar.

The left sidebar contains:
- The page number "28" at the top.
- A vertical navigation menu with "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" at the very top, followed by clickable sections: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board" (highlighted in green), "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information".
- Below the navigation, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing green arrow, a downward-pointing green arrow, and a horizontal triple-bar icon, followed by a refresh/circular arrow icon.

The main content area is divided into two primary columns for text, with visual elements integrated into the lower half.
- The main title "Become the best-connected brewer" spans across both text columns at the top.
- The content is organized under several bolded headings: "Unlocking the value of data", "Data-driven commerce", "Generative AI", "Ethical AI", and "Simplifying and automating our end-to-end business".
- Text flows in a typical left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order within these columns.
- Two large images are placed in the lower half of the page, breaking the two-column text layout. The first image is a photograph, and the second is a diagram.

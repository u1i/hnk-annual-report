## Unlocking profitable growth

Driven by its size and increasing demand in some key markets, the Americas presents a unique opportunity for us. We're strengthening our competitive position by scaling premiumisation led by Heineken®, accelerating innovation, digitising our route-to-consumer and other strategic investments.

### Exceptional performance
Despite high inflation, currency devaluation in Mexico and Brazil, instability in Haiti and Ecuador, and reduced consumer purchasing power in the US, HEINEKEN Americas delivered exceptional performance in 2024.

Our premiumisation strategy continued to drive strong results, with the Heineken® brand leading with high single-digit growth. Amstel® also showed impressive high single-digit growth, with particularly strong results in Brazil and Ecuador. In Panama, Cristal reinforced its position as a differentiated premium brand.

### Innovating in beer and beyond
We continued expanding our portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences. Heineken® Silver, our fresh, world-class light beer, is delivering encouraging results and promising progress in Panama and South America.

In the RTD segment, Amstel Vibes demonstrated strong momentum in Brazil, while Rum Stripe, Piton Vibes and Ricardo gained traction in the Caribbean. Our non-alcoholic beverage portfolio in Brazil achieved remarkable growth, driven by FYS, our low-sugar soft drink.

Making meaningful connections with consumers remained a priority. The UEFA Champions League and Formula 1 were key platforms once again: Heineken® activations such as Chec0.0 Perez in Mexico and Senna in Brazil shared the brand's spirit with local audiences. In Jamaica, a partnership with Usain Bolt highlighted Red Stripe's connection to the island. Our campaigns were once again recognised at Cannes, with the Americas earning five Lions for The Gaming Fridge (Brazil), Out of Home Matches (Brazil), Backing the Bars (Brazil and Argentina) and 0.0 Prohibition (Argentina).

### Investing in growth
We made a range of strategic investments. In Mexico, the Meoqui Can Factory became operational in June, a key milestone in supply chain integration. In Brazil, we advanced construction of the Passos brewery, set to become one of our most sustainable facilities in the region. And in Panama, brewery upgrades enabled local production of Heineken® to begin.

We also made significant progress on our digital journey, with a growing share of fragmented trade revenue now coming through digital channels. As of 2024, more than two thirds of customers use our digital platforms, reflecting the impact of this transformation programme on our business.

### Always a choice
Our low and no-alcohol portfolio continues to achieve double-digit growth, led by Heineken® 0.0, now available in all our 14 operating companies and eight export markets, and Tecate 0.0. In Brazil, we launched Sol Zero, a no-alcohol beer enriched with vitamins D and B.

Programmes promoting moderation, such as Carnival initiatives in the Caribbean and our 'LOVE.LOVE' tennis-themed campaign for Heineken® 0.0 in the US, strengthened our responsible consumption message while showcasing our innovative approach to consumer engagement.

### Sustainability
In Brazil, SPIN, an innovative partnership ecosystem, was launched to drive sustainable models for packaging circularity, regenerative agriculture, energy transition and impact brands.

The roll-out of our decarbonisation programme gained momentum, with Suriname, Peru and Lagunitas transitioning to 100% renewable electricity. A new PPA contract for a wind farm in Bahia State, Brazil, solar projects, biomethane adoption, biomass boiler installations and vehicle electrification initiatives all demonstrated our ambition to scale renewable energy. Water stewardship also improved, with water efficiency reaching record low levels. New water reclamation plants in Mexico and Brazil neared completion.

We remain focused on diversifying leadership, building talent pipeline and fostering inclusivity. Our leadership development programmes are equipping colleagues with career opportunities and supporting the delivery of our EverGreen strategy.

### Layout and Structure
The page is organized into a main content area on the right and a narrow, vertical navigation sidebar on the left. The main content area is further divided into two primary columns for text, with visual elements integrated into the lower half.

The top of the page features the page number "35" and the section title "Americas." Below this, the main heading "Unlocking profitable growth" is prominently displayed in a large, bold, green font.

The text content is structured into several distinct sections with green subheadings: "Exceptional performance," "Innovating in beer and beyond," "Investing in growth," "Always a choice," and "Sustainability." These sections are arranged in two columns, creating a clear and readable flow.

A large quote from Marc Busain is centrally placed in the lower-middle section of the main content area, set apart by a green background and bold text, with his name and title below it.

The left sidebar contains the document title and a list of navigation links, indicating the current section ("Report of the Executive Board") with a darker green background. Below the navigation links, there are four small icons, likely for page navigation or other interactive features.

The bottom portion of the page features several overlaid visual elements (product images and a portrait) that span across the two text columns, creating a dynamic visual layout.

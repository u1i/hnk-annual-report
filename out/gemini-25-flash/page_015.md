**Shape the future of beer and beyond**

### Stretching beyond beer

In 2024, we continued to make strategic investments and expand our portfolio of refreshing brands beyond beer, particularly in markets where beer faces challenges or where significant growth potential exists. This strategy reflects shifting consumer preferences and evolving drinking behaviours, largely driven by Gen Z.

Red Stripe, for example, tapped into their heritage to stretch beyond beer with the expansion of Rum Stripe beyond the US and Jamaica to the UK. Building on its successful launch in Vietnam and Singapore in 2023, Tiger Soju expanded into yet more markets in 2024.

Following our investment in 2023, UK-based ready-to-drink (RTD) brand SERVED introduced premium cocktails and broadened its on and off-trade distribution. We also acquired a small minority stake in Netherlands-based STËLZ, whose low-calorie hard seltzers and spirit mixers resonate with Gen Z consumers. Additionally, a small investment in G Spot, a startup founded by actress Gillian Anderson offering alternatives to traditional wellness brands, is helping us learn about the evolution of functional beverages in the UK.

With an eye on the future, we launched a Beyond Beer incubation hub in the UK to nurture and grow our Beyond Beer portfolio through separate sales and marketing channels. This unit has already introduced Desperados Cocktails and Rum Stripe in select London channels.

### Cider returns to growth

After years of decline, the cider category is back on track, closing 2024 at 8mhl – up organically 2% year-on-year. Momentum was strong in South Africa, Mozambique, Ireland, Spain and the Czech Republic.

In the UK, our cider portfolio continued to grow, powered by the success of Inch's and Old Mout. In South Africa, our cider portfolio outperformed the category thanks to the exceptional performance of Savanna. Innovations including the launch of a premium, whisky-flavoured cider, Savanna Neat, further solidified our leadership position. We successfully pushed the boundaries of the cider category in Spain, with Ladrón de Verano contributing significantly to growth.

"We continued to drive premiumisation with Heineken® leading the way, delivering growth through creativity, quality and meaningful consumer connections. From 0.0 innovation to expanding beyond beer, we're shaping inclusive and rewarding social experiences for consumers worldwide."
Bram Westenbrink
Chief Commercial Officer

## Layout and Structure

The page is structured into a main content area on the right and a narrow vertical navigation sidebar on the left.

The main content area is divided into two primary sections: "Stretching beyond beer" and "Cider returns to growth," each with its own heading. The text is presented in a multi-column layout. The "Stretching beyond beer" section uses two columns for its narrative, while "Cider returns to growth" uses one column.

A large image collage of various products occupies the bottom half of the main content area, extending across the full width of this section. Above this collage, in the upper right, is a portrait image of Bram Westenbrink, accompanied by a quote and his title.

The left sidebar contains the page number "15" at the top, followed by "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024". Below this is a list of document sections, with "Report of the Executive Board" highlighted in a darker green box, indicating the current section. At the very bottom of the sidebar are four small navigation icons.

The overall layout is clean with ample white space, using a consistent font for the main text and a larger, bold green font for section headings.

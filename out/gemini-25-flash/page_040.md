**Risk management**

**Regulatory changes related to alcohol**

**What could happen?**
The topic of alcohol and health is under scrutiny in many
markets. This may prompt regulators to take further
measures limiting HEINEKEN's freedom to operate, for
example, through restrictions or bans on advertising and
marketing, sponsorship, availability of products, adding
health warnings to labels, increased taxes and duties or
imposing minimum unit pricing. This could lead to lower
overall consumption or to consumers switching to different
product categories.

**Recent developments**
Authorities and regulators continue to introduce restrictive
measures on alcohol consumption and sales such as
restrictions on marketing and labelling requirements in
some markets. These measures can have a negative
impact on our business in the affected markets.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
Responsible consumption is an important element of our
Brew a Better World 2030 strategy, because HEINEKEN
strongly believes in the importance of reducing alcohol-
related harm. By using the power and reach of our brands
through campaigns like the award-winning 'When You
Drive Never Drink', HEINEKEN strives to make responsible
consumption aspirational for all consumers. We aim to
invest at least 10% of Heineken® media spend into
responsible consumption campaigns each year, aiming to
reach one billion consumers.

We also work closely with stakeholders to prevent and
reduce the harm caused by abuse such as underage
drinking or drinking and driving. Our operating companies
are engaging in formal partnerships with local
stakeholders (like governments, NGOs or specialists) to
tackle harmful drinking.

We also stepped up our product labelling guidelines to
provide consumers with more information about our
products. We are aiming for clear and transparent
consumer information on 100% of our products in scope,
including full nutritional information and ingredients on
pack, recycling and legal drinking age symbols and a QR
code on pack that links to further information on alcohol
and health.

**Economic and political environment**

**What could happen?**
Throughout the world, local or regional economic and
political uncertainties could impact our business and that
of our customers. In particular, the risk of an economic
recession, change of law, trade restrictions, inflation,
fluctuations in exchange rates, devaluation,
nationalisation, financial crisis or social unrest could
adversely affect our revenues and profits.

**Recent developments**
The global economy could trend to a slow down due to an
uncertain geopolitical landscape impacted by the war in
Ukraine, conflicts in Africa and Middle East, and trade
blocks and tariff risks due to tension between US and
China. Prior years of elevated inflation and tightening of
monetary policy have led to increased risks to global
growth. While global monetary policy may start to ease,
structural shifts in industries, and reduction in real
disposable income and consumer sentiment may lead to a
prolonged recession of the global economy, decline in
consumer spending and adverse movement in exchange
rates. Public debt, the disruption of global value chains and
barriers to the cross-border movement of people and
goods are other key risk factors. Anticipating risks and
business agility has become a priority to enable our
businesses to navigate subsequent changes in laws,
currency movements, import restrictions, scarcity of hard
currencies, commodity pricing and their impact on the
Company's profit.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
HEINEKEN has set up various tools to limit the impact of
such events on its business. They include strategic supplier
management, short-term liquidity management, active
foreign exchange monitoring, and prudent balance sheet
measures. There is a quarterly risk management process in
place to review and anticipate material risks to our
businesses, a review in respect to resource allocation,
various cost and value optimisation initiatives, and risks
and opportunity assessments. We conduct monthly
business performance review, and a monthly rolling
forecast instead of fixed forecasts updates throughout the
year. We also expressly introduced much more mid and
long-term scenario planning and contingency
management.

HEINEKEN has monitoring mechanisms in place globally
and locally to allow us to monitor, report and engage
proactively on political risks. For events which could
threaten the continuity of the business, contingency plans
are in place. With our strategic priority of 'Fund the growth,
fuel the profit', HEINEKEN continuously reviews its cost
base to drive productivity and increase operating leverage.

**Environmental legislation**

**What could happen?**
HEINEKEN may not be able to respond promptly to the
impact of environment-related changes on our operations.
The introduction of new environmental legislation and
developments in case law could lead to legal claims,
increased compliance costs, restrictions on our production,
packaging, distribution, selling and marketing activities.
This could also damage our reputation, limit our license to
operate and negatively impact our business.

**Recent developments**
The global economy may slow down due to an uncertain
political landscape. Meanwhile the pace and scale of
environment-related changes on our operations are
accelerating. This creates tension between adapting
swiftly to avoid restrictions and the financial impact of the
significant sustainability investments needed to
ensure compliance.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
Environmental sustainability is a key priority of
HEINEKEN's Brew a Better World sustainable development
strategy. HEINEKEN continuously monitors existing and
emerging environmental issues and regulations globally to
ensure compliance and to prepare the business for future
challenges. We regularly assess current and upcoming
regulations, looking at technical feasibility and financial
impact, with cross-functional teams in place to implement
the necessary actions.

Beyond this, HEINEKEN closely works with experts,
including NGOs, universities, governments and suppliers
across the value chain. We also partner with peer
companies through international and national platforms
such as The Brewers of Europe, the Beverage Industry
Environmental Roundtable and the Dutch Sustainable
Growth Coalition.

**Changing consumer & beverage trends**

**What could happen?**
Consumers have an ever-expanding choice of beverages
and brands available to meet their needs. There is an
increasing risk of non-beer competitors reaching the same
consumers and occasions as beer players. This requires
HEINEKEN to constantly adapt its product offering,
innovate and invest to maintain the relevance and
strength of its brands, while meeting new and evolving
consumer needs. Failure to do so would, in the longer term,
affect our revenues, market share and, possibly, our
brand equity.

**Recent developments**
The beverage landscape is rapidly changing, with some
categories growing faster than beer. There's a significant
risk of losing market share to other beverages, as long-held
boundaries between beer, wine, spirits and non-alcoholic
beverages are blurring, changing the face of competition
and stretching brands into new domains.

Within the beer category, the rise of low- and no-alcohol
products have been the most noticeable changes due to
an increased consumer focus on health and well-being.
Beyond beer, the significant diversification of choice in
ready to drink beverages is remarkable but volatile. Thus, it
is crucial to offer relevant propositions that resonate with
consumers and meet their evolving needs.

**What are we doing to manage this risk?**
The evolving beverage landscape presents both
opportunities and risks for HEINEKEN. To succeed,
HEINEKEN needs to focus on brand building,
premiumisation, differentiation from other beverage
categories, and adapting to changing consumer
preferences and behaviours. The key commercial levers
that are considered priorities for every market are: brand
power increase for strategic and game changer brands,
innovation boost in beer including low- and no-alcohol and
beyond beer, maximisation of distribution and value
creation through smart pricing, promotions, pack/price
architecture and trade terms.

HEINEKEN is constantly working to maintain, develop and
strengthen its portfolio and competitive advantages, in
particular, in Premium spaces, through an integrated
Brand Building Process, making it more appealing to
consumers. HEINEKEN has also embarked on an extensive
Consumer Inspired Growth programme, helping us move
from knowing beer to knowing consumers. By thoroughly
understanding consumer needs in beer and beyond and
comparing them within and across markets, we can
uncover scalable innovation opportunities.

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured into two main vertical sections. The left section, narrower than the right, serves as a navigation sidebar. The right section, which occupies the majority of the page, contains the main content.

The navigation sidebar on the left is dark green and lists key sections of the Annual Report:
- "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024" at the top.
- A list of sections: "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information".
- Below these, there are four small icons: an upward-pointing triangle, a downward-pointing triangle, three horizontal lines, and a circular arrow. These likely represent navigation controls (e.g., previous page, next page, table of contents, refresh/home).

The main content area on the right is white with black text. It is titled "Risk management" at the top. Below this main title, the content is divided into four distinct columns, each addressing a specific risk area:
1.  **Regulatory changes related to alcohol**
2.  **Economic and political environment**
3.  **Environmental legislation**
4.  **Changing consumer & beverage trends**

Each of these four columns follows a consistent sub-structure:
- A bold heading for the risk area.
- A sub-section titled "What could happen?" describing potential impacts.
- A sub-section titled "Recent developments" outlining current trends.
- A sub-section titled "What are we doing to manage this risk?" detailing Heineken's strategies.
- Each column concludes with a green text box containing an "Explore further" link, directing the reader to relevant page numbers in the report for more information.

The text within each column is justified, and paragraphs are clearly separated by line breaks. The overall layout is clean and organized, facilitating easy readability and comparison of the different risk categories.

### Visual References

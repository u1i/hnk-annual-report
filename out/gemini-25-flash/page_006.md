### Layout and Structure
The page is structured into two main vertical sections. The left-most section is a narrow, fixed navigation bar with the company name, report title, and a list of report sections, along with four small navigation icons at the bottom. The main content occupies the larger right section of the page.

The main content area is divided into five distinct financial tables: "Consolidated results," "Per share," "Employees," "Balance sheet," and "Ratios." Each table has a bold green heading. The tables are presented in a two-column format for data (2024 and 2023) and a third column for "Change in %" or "Change." The "Consolidated results" and "Per share" tables are positioned side-by-side in the upper half of the main content area. The "Employees," "Balance sheet," and "Ratios" tables are stacked vertically below them.

A footnote is located at the bottom center of the main content area, providing a definition for "(beia)." The overall layout is clean, with ample white space, and uses a light green highlight for the 2024 data column in each table. A large, abstract green wave-like graphic occupies the bottom right quadrant of the page, extending from the middle of the page to the bottom.

## Appendix: Visual Elements

### Visual Element 1: Navigation Bar
**Location:** Far left edge of the page, spanning its full height.
**Size:** Narrow, approximately 10% of the page width.
**Description:** A solid green vertical bar containing white text labels for different sections of the annual report and four small, white, minimalist icons at the bottom. The text includes "Heineken N.V.", "Annual Report 2024", "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information". The icons are an upward-pointing triangle, a downward-pointing triangle, three horizontal lines (menu/hamburger icon), and a circular arrow (refresh/reload icon).
**Content/Data:** Text labels for report sections and navigation icons.
**Purpose:** Provides quick access to different sections of the digital report and indicates the current page's context within the report structure.

### Visual Element 2: Green Highlighted Data Columns
**Location:** Within all financial tables (Consolidated results, Per share, Employees, Balance sheet, Ratios).
**Size:** Varies depending on the table, but consistently highlights the '2024' column.
**Description:** The background of the entire '2024' data column in each table is a light, translucent green. This visual cue helps to quickly identify the most recent year's data.
**Content/Data:** Highlights the numerical values for the year 2024.
**Purpose:** To visually emphasize the current year's performance data, making it easier for the reader to locate and compare.

### Visual Element 3: Abstract Green Graphic
**Location:** Bottom right quadrant of the page, extending from about mid-page height to the bottom edge.
**Size:** Large, covering approximately 40% of the page area.
**Description:** A flowing, abstract graphic composed of multiple translucent green lines and shapes that overlap and intertwine, creating a wave-like or organic pattern. The lines vary in thickness and intensity of green, giving it a sense of depth and movement. It appears to be a decorative element rather than a data visualization.
**Content/Data:** None, purely decorative.
**Purpose:** To add visual interest, reinforce brand aesthetics (green is a prominent color for Heineken), and provide a background element without distracting from the financial data.

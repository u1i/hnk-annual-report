**Building a modern Digital Backbone**

HEINEKEN is on a journey to become the world's best-connected brewer, powered by a cutting-edge Digital Backbone. This transformation replaces our previously fragmented technology landscape with a modern, modular architecture that combines a lean Digital CORE with standardised cloud-based platforms. The resulting industry-leading technology enables new ways of working, enhanced customer service, end-to-end efficiencies and rapid scaling of capabilities globally – all the while staying agile for future innovation.

2024 was a pivotal year marked by the successful deployment of pilots in three operating companies. These pilots tested the integration of all 35 of our Digital Backbone applications across diverse business models, markets and tech starting points. In our pilot operating company, the system exceeded expectations, going live without disruption.

Within two months, the operating company achieved record-breaking sales and production, underscoring the system's potential to boost efficiency and performance.

User feedback post-launch reinforced the positive impact of the new architecture's experience. Similar outcomes followed in Serbia and Egypt, solidifying the Digital Backbone's readiness for broader implementation.

With our consolidated future digital landscape in mind, we've stepped up our cybersecurity and system resilience to make sure we're best placed to protect the business against ever-increasing global digital threats.

**Creating a digitally enabled organisation**

It's crucial that we have the right skills and capabilities both within our global Digital and Technology function and across all of HEINEKEN. In 2024, we continued to step up these capabilities, empowering teams with skills and tools that enable an agile, future-fit business.

Our global digital hubs are at the heart of this transformation, serving as engines of innovation and delivery. These hubs ensure consistent, cost-effective implementation of capabilities across our operating companies.

This year we began to set up a global Commerce DevOps hub to support our strategic e-commerce operations and a Technology Platforms & Sourcing Hub for Europe in Krakow. We also enhanced existing hubs with additional capabilities, including Data & Analytics, for example.

We also formally established and expanded Tiger Tribe, our global innovation and digital product development team, at our hub in Ho Chi Minh City. Our 'Tigers' collaborate with internal and external partners to address critical business challenges, from enhancing customer experience to optimising supply chains. The team is a game changer for HEINEKEN and is already leveraging GenAI to deliver product development and innovation cost-effectively at speed and scale.

By the end of 2024, our hubs were powered by more than 700 tech-specialists, up from 20 in 2021. This remarkable growth underscores our commitment to creating a digitally enabled organisation that attracts, develops and retains diverse talents within HEINEKEN's Digital and Technology function.

"Our digital transformation merges HEINEKEN's deep understanding of local consumers, customers and communities with the power of global scale, big data and enterprise knowledge. Through data and AI, we're not just optimising operations – we're fostering smarter, more meaningful connections worldwide, enabling our business to thrive in a rapidly changing world."

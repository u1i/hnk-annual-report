We innovate across beer to respond to market
opportunities and to grow the category. This
includes a focus on premiumisation that is led
by Heineken® but driven across the breadth of
our portfolio. We continue to extend our
portfolio of low-calorie, flavoured and less bitter
variants to meet emerging consumer demand
and build our leadership in low and no-alcohol
beverages.

While beer remains fundamental to our
business, there are opportunities for growth
beyond the category. We continue to invest in
cider and other refreshing line extensions to
keep our portfolio modern and relevant.

“
Culture Pulse spots trends in culture that
Heineken® can play an authentic part in and
delivers timely, relevant and provocative
campaigns. In this way, we deliver stories that
get people talking and bring our point of view on
socialising into the conversation."

### Layout and Structure
The page is structured with a left-hand navigation sidebar and a large main content area.
The left sidebar, colored dark green, contains the page number "11" at the top, followed by the company and document title "Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2024". Below this, a series of white text boxes serve as a table of contents or navigation menu, listing sections such as "Introduction", "Report of the Executive Board", "Report of the Supervisory Board", "Financial Statements", "Sustainability Statements", and "Other Information". Below the navigation boxes, there are three small icons: an upward-pointing arrow, a downward-pointing arrow, and a horizontal three-line menu icon, followed by a circular refresh/undo arrow icon at the very bottom.

The main content area occupies approximately 80% of the page width and is dominated by a large photograph. Overlaying the right side of this photograph is a large, bright green rectangular block containing the primary text content. This block is positioned in the upper right quadrant of the page. Below the green block, and overlaying the lower part of the photograph, is a large quote in white text, followed by its attribution. At the very bottom center of the page, there is a small, rounded rectangular button with a call to action. The overall design uses a strong contrast between the dark background of the image and the bright green and white text for emphasis.
